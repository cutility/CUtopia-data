In particular, the cellular and molecular levels enable us to appreciate how excitable cells such as neurons communicate within the human body by utilizing electrical voltages created by the movement of electrolytes across cell membranes. The generation of these micro- voltages is an important functional basis of various organ systems, such as the nervous system and the cardiovascular system. In physiology, one of the primary ions of electrolytes is the sodium ion, which plays essential roles in determining plasma osmolarity, water balance and even blood pressure. The human body also has an amazing ability to interpret and process both light and sound waves so we can see and hear. In this foundation course, medical students are introduced to various aspects of basic science and organ-specific human physiology essential for an understanding of how the human body functions. They are exposed to important concepts from both the chemical and physical sciences, which they then relate to human cell and organ functions. Selected case studies are also used to aid students in understanding the medical relevance of these concepts.", "outcome": "By the end of the course, students should be able to: describe general functions of plasma membrane and different cell organelles. describe four physical processes of heat transfer, and relate them to the body and the mechanism of body temperature control. recognize the bioelectrical properties of a neuron and describe different types of ion channels involved in neural conduction. review the general organization of the nervous system and appreciate the importance of homeostatic control system. distinguish electrolytes and non-electrolytes in body fluid and describe briefly how osmolality and selective permeability of cell membrane are important in determining water balance. review the general physiology of cardiovascular system in the control of blood pressure. identify major chemical and physiological buffering systems in the human body.", "syllabus": "Lecture Topics: The ingredients of life Cell organelles and cell membrane The electrochemical signals of excitable cells Integration of signals and body control: Nervous system Heat, energy and body temperature Flow, pressure and elasticity Body circulation: Cardio-vascular system Water, electrolytes and body fluid compartments Acids and bases Auto-marking exercises or quizzes (topic-specific)", "required_readings": "Basic Concepts in Biomedical Sciences I, CUHK \u2013 CUSTOM, Taylor and Francis (2015) (ISBN: 9781138181939)", "recommended_readings": "Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function.
