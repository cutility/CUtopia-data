Urban development in China since the economic reform has been transformative in its scale and pace of city-building and is a range of outcomes such as rapid economic development, growing income inequality, massive population mobility, and serious institutional challenges. After offering an overview of modern China\u2019s quest for urbanization since the late imperial era, this course will focus on the massive and rapid urbanizing process in the post-reform era. Students will be exposed to diverse issues, such as migration, population control, land policy, housing reform, urban planning, spatial reconfiguration, social welfare, inner-city poverty, infrastructure and transportation, environmental protection, and public space. The readings, drawn from multiple disciplines such as economics, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and urban studies will examine the socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that contribute to the process and its particularities in the late-socialist context. This course will also seek to draw comparative lessons from China\u2019s experience to obtain a comparative understanding of the complex socioeconomic consequences and diverse patterns of urbanizing processes across the globe.", "outcome": "By the end of the semester, students should:\u00a0- be familiar with the key issues of urbanization in the Chinese context.\u00a0- be familiar with key concepts and social theories of current research in urban studies.\u00a0- be able to read and understand interdisciplinary academic publications on urban China.\u00a0- develop both oral and written skills to present coherent and succinct analysis.\u00a0- be prepared for developing senior projects.", "syllabus": "1.
