", "syllabus": "I. IntroductionThe introductory lecture will articulate the objectives of this core requirement in the context of the history and mission of CUHK, as well as the challenges facing Hong Kong as a special administrative region of China and as a major international metropolis in an increasingly globalized world. It will outline the different themes and topics to be covered, and how they contribute to the overall structure of the course.\u00a0II. Understanding China: Intellectual FoundationsCulture has significant transformative power on the individual and society. It informs identity and the collective imagination. It shapes beliefs and values. In the Chinese context, the influence of Confucian, Daoist and Buddhist traditions has been deep-rooted and pervasive, finding expression in every level of Chinese society and every level of Chinese life, in ethics and religion, laws and government, education and science, art and architecture and other aspects of material culture, and shaping the ways in which people relate to each other, and how they view the world. Selected core concepts which figure prominently in the Chinese intellectual and cultural tradition will be critically examined, including the concepts of order and harmony, the junzi-ideal person, ren or benevolence and empathetic concern, li or ritual and propriety, and dao or the way. These ideas provide an entry into a world of ideas that is not only critical to understanding China but also significant to global dialogue.\u00a0III. History as Mirror: Looking at Today\u2019s China from the PastThe purpose of this part of the course is not to rehearse the history of China, but to explore the recurrent themes and conceptual underpinnings that fuel and impact the remarkable phenomenon of China rising. \u00a0We will examine five themes: (a) The grand unification of the Qin dynasty, and the central government and the standardization measures it introduced; (b) The Silk Road, consisting of a network of commercial and cultural cities leading from the ancient capitals of China through India and Central Asia all the way to the Mediterranean Coast, revealing the many-faceted and multi-levelled relations between China and the West; (c) Tang Cosmopolitanism, representing a golden age of cultural development which embraced an open-door policy, with the Chinese capital serving as a major centre of art, literature, philosophy and religion in Asia; (d) The Confucian Civil Service Examination, a three-tiered examination system administered at the local, provincial and national levels, which served for centuries as a method of recruiting civil officials, and can be said to be a model of participatory equality and meritocracy; and (e) The century of humiliation, covering the period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China by Western Powers\u00a0 and Japan, from the Opium War to the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. \u00a0IV. China\u2019s Road to Modernisation\u00a0The multi-faceted process of modernisation and social change demands careful attention. The modernisation of China can be distinguished from that of the Western nations in its being a historical movement of national salvation and self-empowerment, and also as a historical struggle to become one of the multiple centres of the world from a position of the periphery. From the perspective of social change, the country\u2019s modernisation involved giant transformations from an agricultural civilisation to an industrial one, from a monarchy to a republic, and from the study of Confucian classics to the study of science, in a leap from \u201ctradition\u201d to \u201cmodernity\u201d. This part of the course will discuss the underlying patterns of Chinese modernisation in relation to selected historical events of late Qing and Republican China, as well as the reforms of the People\u2019s Republic of China, addressing issues such as the relationship between modernisation and Westernisation, and the possibility of different forms of modernity in the context of globalisation.\u00a0V. The Chinese Economy: Past, Present and FutureThis part of the course looks at the Chinese economy in the context of the global economy. It reviews the economic development of China from the late Qing period to the present day, comparing it to the economy of other nations and with a focus on the developments since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, as well as projections for the future. The review makes reference to a wide range of economic indicators, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, employment, imports and exports, income distribution, national savings, and infrastructure investment, as well as development strategies such as the dual-circulation economic development strategy and the internationalisation of the Renminbi. The lecture will also examine indicators related to sustainable development such as literacy and educational attainments, public health, prevention of climate change, air and water quality and the eradication of extreme poverty.\u00a0VI. Science and Technology in China\u00a0In the twenty-first century, science and technology are becoming an increasingly important facet of modernization for China, driving first an industrial and then an innovation economy, with major impacts on improving livelihood and in geopolitical competition. The topics covered in this part of the course include the Four Great Inventions, mathematics and astronomy in ancient and medieval China, and the question raised by Needham on why modern science emerged in Europe but not in China. Developments since the late Ming period are discussed with reference to science brought by missionaries, and the political, social and cultural reforms from the mid-19th century onwards. A critical examination will be provided of two recent periods, which saw achievements in a few centrally directed projects starting in the 1960s, and advances across a broad front since about 1980, but showing weaknesses in some sectors.

Introduction: Basic Concepts and ThemesBuilding on the knowledge foundation provided by the course \u201cUnderstanding China\u201d (UGCP1001), this course focuses on understanding Hong Kong in the context of China and situating \u201cHong Kong in the wider constitutional order.\u201d This opening lecture introduces the notion of constitutional order and the methodology of the course by emphasizing a trilogy of themes: law, security, and development. The security themes such as national security, international security, global security, and cyber security have become popular topics attracting the attention and efforts of academics the world over. There is a growing consensus that security has become a crucial and common interest for all human societies to survive and develop as a city, a country, and one world. Based on the interlocking themes of security, law and development, this course provides longer-term perspectives on Hong Kong in the wider constitutional order.\u00a0II. China\u2019s Rise: A Bicentennial Perspective\u00a0II-1. The 1840 Dilemma: A Brief History of State FailureThis lecture focuses on the notion of \u201cnational insecurity\u201d emerging in mid-19th century China. After the Opium War waged by Britain against China, China gradually became a failed state. This post-opium-war state failure is referred to as \u201cChina\u2019s 1840 dilemma\u201d, which reflects, in essence, multiple national security dimensions.\u00a0II-2. New China: China\u2019s Rise and its Global ImplicationsThis lecture introduces the notion of a \u201cnew China\u201d. China\u2019s global rise not only speaks to its great achievement in light of national development, but also indicates the growing concern for national security (vs. national insecurity). The correlation between national development and national security takes a central place in understanding China\u2019s rise and its global implications. \u00a0\u00a0III. Dimensions of State Capacity and National Security\u00a0III-1. State Capacity and National DevelopmentThis lecture discusses in detail the crucial importance of state capacity for national development. Students are encouraged to understand the notion of state capacity and effective government, which combine to provide the pivotal foundation for the achievements of national security, constitutional order, and national development.\u00a0III-2. National Security Capacity: A New DevelopmentThis lecture begins with a comparison of the United States of America (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) with respect to recent developments in their respective national security strategies, which converge on national security capacity building through a comprehensive \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach. The policies and laws China has recently adopted and legislated are nothing new or exceptional. This background knowledge provides a good starting point for understanding the Hong Kong National Security Law.\u00a0IV. One Country, Two Systems: Past and Present\u00a0IV-1. Unitary State: Constitutional Legacies of Ancient ChinaThe main purpose of this lecture is to explain the notion of a unitary state, which provides the historical and constitutional foundation for both \u201cone country\u201d and \u201ctwo systems\u201d. The notion of a unitary state will be explained in great detail in comparative terms. The Chinese constitutional wisdom in implementing \u201cone country, many systems\u201d under the rubric of a unitary state sheds light on the historical roots of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d in Hong Kong. \u00a0IV-2. \u00a0One Country, Two Systems: an in-depth and comprehensive overview Critical to our understanding of Hong Kong in the wider constitutional order is developing an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems (OCTS)\u201d policy. Emphasis is placed on the close reading of original documents, namely, the three sets of official documents which chart the evolution of the OCTS policy: the speeches of Deng Xiaoping on Hong Kong, and the two White Papers of the State Council (2014/2021). IV-3. \u00a0Hong Kong Basic Law as a Chinese National Law This lecture focuses on the Hong Kong Basic Law (HKBL). The main point of this lecture is that Hong Kong Basic Law is a national law of China. Chinese citizens across the country without exception abide by this law. About one-fifth of the 160 articles of the HKBL contain the term \u201cthe central government\u201d. These articles substantiate the principle of \u201cOne Country\u201d within the text of the HKBL, highlighting the pivotal importance of these articles in maintaining the wider constitutional order.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0V. National Security in the Wider Constitutional Order\u00a0V-1. Constitution and National SecurityBuilding on the preceding lectures on the notions of a unitary state, the primacy of \u201cone country\u201d, and the constitutional principles of nationalism, this lecture explains the relation of national security to the constitution. Adopting a comparative perspective, this lecture starts with the \u201cnational security constitution\u201d conception in the United States. One takeaway from this week\u2019s lecture is that national security is part of constitutional law, and it is a misconception to think of a national security law merely as a criminal law or an emergency law.\u00a0V-2. Law as Safeguard: General principles of HKNSL This lecture guides students in learning about The Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereafter \u201cHong Kong National Security Law\u201d, or HKNSL) by focusing on the general principles, and provides a comparative perspective based on a survey of the 1947 National Security Act of the United States. HKNSL is first and foremost a national law of China that empowers both the nation and region to safeguard national security in the HKSAR after June 30, 2020. The innermost essence of this law is about the central government\u2019s overarching responsibility in safeguarding national security for all Chinese, country-wide and region-wide. Second, this law safeguards the authority of the HKSAR government to lawfully guard national sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity, and other major national security interests in Hong Kong. \u00a0\u00a0V-3. National Security Framework CasesThere are two categories of cases which apply different laws. For cases in Category One, which arise from \u201cthe events in 2019\u201d, effective laws in Hong Kong other than HKNSL can be cited as the authority in making judgments. In those cases, no citation of the HKNSL is allowed, because HKNSL is a non-retroactive law. Only for cases in Category Two, that is, the \u201cnational security cases\u201d, which arose after the HKNSL took effect in Hong Kong, can HKNSL be cited as the authority to decide a case. Making a difference between the two categories of cases is important. This lecture discusses some recent court cases pertaining to HKNSL and the constitutional significance of these cases. \u00a0V-4. \u00a0Imagining the Future of \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201dThis final lecture concludes the course by recommending a longer-term perspective on law, development and security in the context of Hong Kong as a special administrative region of China. Everyone has an important part to play in contributing to the betterment of Hong Kong in the wider constitutional order. ", "required_readings": "II.
