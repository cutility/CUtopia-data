", "syllabus": "I. IntroductionThe introductory lecture will articulate the objectives of this core requirement in the context of the history and mission of CUHK, as well as the challenges facing Hong Kong as a special administrative region of China and as a major international metropolis in an increasingly globalized world. It will outline the different themes and topics to be covered, and how they contribute to the overall structure of the course.\u00a0II. Understanding China: Intellectual FoundationsCulture has significant transformative power on the individual and society. It informs identity and the collective imagination. It shapes beliefs and values. In the Chinese context, the influence of Confucian, Daoist and Buddhist traditions has been deep-rooted and pervasive, finding expression in every level of Chinese society and every level of Chinese life, in ethics and religion, laws and government, education and science, art and architecture and other aspects of material culture, and shaping the ways in which people relate to each other, and how they view the world. Selected core concepts which figure prominently in the Chinese intellectual and cultural tradition will be critically examined, including the concepts of order and harmony, the junzi-ideal person, ren or benevolence and empathetic concern, li or ritual and propriety, and dao or the way. These ideas provide an entry into a world of ideas that is not only critical to understanding China but also significant to global dialogue.\u00a0III. History as Mirror: Looking at Today\u2019s China from the PastThe purpose of this part of the course is not to rehearse the history of China, but to explore the recurrent themes and conceptual underpinnings that fuel and impact the remarkable phenomenon of China rising. \u00a0We will examine five themes: (a) The grand unification of the Qin dynasty, and the central government and the standardization measures it introduced; (b) The Silk Road, consisting of a network of commercial and cultural cities leading from the ancient capitals of China through India and Central Asia all the way to the Mediterranean Coast, revealing the many-faceted and multi-levelled relations between China and the West; (c) Tang Cosmopolitanism, representing a golden age of cultural development which embraced an open-door policy, with the Chinese capital serving as a major centre of art, literature, philosophy and religion in Asia; (d) The Confucian Civil Service Examination, a three-tiered examination system administered at the local, provincial and national levels, which served for centuries as a method of recruiting civil officials, and can be said to be a model of participatory equality and meritocracy; and (e) The century of humiliation, covering the period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China by Western Powers\u00a0 and Japan, from the Opium War to the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. \u00a0IV. China\u2019s Road to Modernisation\u00a0The multi-faceted process of modernisation and social change demands careful attention. The modernisation of China can be distinguished from that of the Western nations in its being a historical movement of national salvation and self-empowerment, and also as a historical struggle to become one of the multiple centres of the world from a position of the periphery. From the perspective of social change, the country\u2019s modernisation involved giant transformations from an agricultural civilisation to an industrial one, from a monarchy to a republic, and from the study of Confucian classics to the study of science, in a leap from \u201ctradition\u201d to \u201cmodernity\u201d. This part of the course will discuss the underlying patterns of Chinese modernisation in relation to selected historical events of late Qing and Republican China, as well as the reforms of the People\u2019s Republic of China, addressing issues such as the relationship between modernisation and Westernisation, and the possibility of different forms of modernity in the context of globalisation.\u00a0V. The Chinese Economy: Past, Present and FutureThis part of the course looks at the Chinese economy in the context of the global economy. It reviews the economic development of China from the late Qing period to the present day, comparing it to the economy of other nations and with a focus on the developments since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, as well as projections for the future. The review makes reference to a wide range of economic indicators, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, employment, imports and exports, income distribution, national savings, and infrastructure investment, as well as development strategies such as the dual-circulation economic development strategy and the internationalisation of the Renminbi. The lecture will also examine indicators related to sustainable development such as literacy and educational attainments, public health, prevention of climate change, air and water quality and the eradication of extreme poverty.\u00a0VI. Science and Technology in China\u00a0In the twenty-first century, science and technology are becoming an increasingly important facet of modernization for China, driving first an industrial and then an innovation economy, with major impacts on improving livelihood and in geopolitical competition. The topics covered in this part of the course include the Four Great Inventions, mathematics and astronomy in ancient and medieval China, and the question raised by Needham on why modern science emerged in Europe but not in China. Developments since the late Ming period are discussed with reference to science brought by missionaries, and the political, social and cultural reforms from the mid-19th century onwards. A critical examination will be provided of two recent periods, which saw achievements in a few centrally directed projects starting in the 1960s, and advances across a broad front since about 1980, but showing weaknesses in some sectors.
