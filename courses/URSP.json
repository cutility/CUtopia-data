Students are expected to apply appropriate urban design skills to creatively and critically address a spatial issue in the urban area. Part I (URSP4003) of the two capstone projects concentrates on the identification of an existing urban design issue\u2014either a city-wide or a localized issue\u2014that has not been effectively addressed, the review existing discourses and design projects relevant to the identified issue, and a comprehensive site analysis. Part II (URSP4004) focuses on the development of an urban design scheme that addresses this issue while pushing the boundaries of the established discourses and design approaches to achieve more sustainable and creative solutions.", "outcome": "After taking this course, students will be able to:\u00a0\u2022 develop urban design skills to carry out an urban design scheme that incorporates major physical elements of the city, i.e., buildings, open spaces, streets, transport, and infrastructure, to meet urban development goals.;\u00a0\u2022 apply visual communication techniques to effectively represent urban design concepts and solutions;\u00a0\u2022 cultivate creative solutions to urban development;\u00a0\u2022 nurture critical thinking in issues associated with urban built environment.", "syllabus": "A capstone thesis/project handbook will be produced to provide guidance to students.", "required_readings": "Creme, P. & Lea, M.R.
