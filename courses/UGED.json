purpose. This definition implies that successful individuals engage in purposeful, agentic pursuits. Success in attaining task goals confers a feeling of competence; success in reaching relationship goals gives one a feeling of acceptance. Both feelings are major ingredients of mental health. Success in attaining valued goals requires the abilities to adapt to change. These abilities include openness to diverse ideas, cognitive flexibility, creativity, emotional stability, motivation and perseverance. Behavioural research has shown that success is more likely among people who possess several self-attributes. In this course, we will empower students with theoretical and empirical knowledge of these attributes, and engage them in weekly experiential activities, through which they will develop and weave these self-attributes into their daily goal pursuits. Through the use of a self-assessment online platform, student will track their personal growth in these self-attributes. Major aspects of the successful self that will be covered in this course are: the rational self, veridical self-knowledge, the transcendent self, the socially intelligent self, the loved self, the multicultural self, and the global self.This course is closely related to the SDG subgoal of promoting mental health and well-being. First, psychological well-being ensues from attaining one's valued goals. In addition, feeling competent and feeling accepted are two pillars of psychological maturity and mental health. In this course, students will learn the concepts and practical skills that would enable students to more effectively attain their valued goal, and feel competent and accepted.", "outcome": " Students who complete this course are expected to be able to \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Understand the key factors that contribute to a successful self (LO1) 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Critically evaluate the empirical evidence for major theories of successful self (LO2) 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apply evidence-based theories of successful self to self-improvement (LO3) 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Track their changes in pertinent self-attributes through experiential learning and longitudinal measures of these attributes (LO4)", "syllabus": " Topic 1: Adaptive intelligence: The ability of the mind to be able to change in response to the current demand in the environment \u00a0 Topic 2: The irrational self: People are predictably irrational \u00a0 Topic 3: The perils of addiction to self-esteem: Narcissistic people are emotionally unstable and socially hostile \u00a0 Topic 4: Defensive pessimism: The emotional price people pay for their desire for performance \u00a0 Topic 5: Know thyself: Self-knowledge and its positive effects on emotional wellbeing, motivation, performance and achievement \u00a0 Topic 6: Self-beliefs: Their consequences on motivation, achievement, perseverance, psychological resilience and mental health. \u00a0 Topic 7: Softening of the boundary self-identity: How does this reduce group-centrism and promote collaboration and innovation? \u00a0 Topic 8: The socially intelligent self: How do you attain your goal and cultivate good relationships at the same time? \u00a0 Topic 9: The loved self: When waiting for Mr./Ms. Right is not right \u00a0 Topic 10: The multicultural self: How multicultural experiences increase your flexibility and creativity \u00a0 Topic 11: The global self: How having a global mindset increases performance in the global era", "required_readings": " Topic 1: Adaptive intelligence: The ability of the mind to be able to change in response to the current demand in the environment Sternberg, R.

Death is not special. It happens every day and everywhere. It is also an inevitable part of life. Yet, death is very important for us especially when we are confronted by the death and dying of our loved ones. Surprisingly, we have done little to prepare ourselves to get familiar with the topic of bereavement. Very often we learn it only from the most painful and heartbreaking moments in life\u2014after the death of loved ones. While bereavement may induce us different grief reactions, and adjustment difficulties, it also provides an opportunity for us to experience personal growth, reflect on our values and search for the meaning in life. As a result, this course aims to prepare students to face death, dying and bereavement that they may encounter in their life. In particular, they are facilitated to respond to a unique question, \u201cHow can I live with the grief?\u201d This question can only be answered by the students themselves who will have an opportunity to understand more about death, dying and bereavement, as well as reflecting on their life and living through this course.

This is a cross-disciplinary course straddles the studies of history, anthropology, and sociology from the perspective of material objects. The course intends to achieve two goals: first, it leads students to identify and appreciate the traditional Chinese values, which include the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, embodied in the many production types pertinent to what we now regard as Chinese; and second, it explains how those various material types ended up being included and translated as the representative categories of Chinese civilization throughout the historical times. The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods. The discussions instruct students to appreciate these essential elements of Chinese culture from the perspectives of their physical qualities, craftsmanship, and historical values. They are also to encourage students to think about the roles of material objects in shaping cultural, ethnic, and even national identities.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to identify the material and artistic features of some mainstream Chinese artifacts; develop interests in Chinese culture from the perspective of objects; identify key historical sites and remains of pre-modern China; develop acute senses for appreciating traditions and values; develop interests in culture and history; analyze the sources of Chinese heritage and traditions; think critically about historical and other relevant cultural presentations; and get prepared for further trainings in the disciplines of art history, archaeology, anthropology and history.", "syllabus": "1. Introduction: What is the present view about Chinese material culture? \u00a0Present-day China received huge inheritance from the many groups of people and cultural traditions that existed in antiquity. This session introduce a range of material culture that makes up the broad family of Chinese culture. The most important types include jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, and architecture. The definitions given here hope to broaden the scope and include the less-discussed categories of clothing and costumes, sculpture, and grave goods. This overview leads students to consider the many sources of traditional values now embodied in the material culture that we now describe as \u2018Chinese\u2019.\u00a0\u00a02. Jades\u00a0In China, jades have always been understood to have spiritual power and artistic values. What is the scientific definition of jades? How did Confucius and his contemporaries define the roles of jades? How did their teachings shape the understanding of jades in Chinese society? And what are the present views about jades? This session will respond to this question by giving a review of jade history, usage and craftsmanship.\u00a0\u00a03. Antique bronzes\u00a0Among the many treasures inherited from the past, bronzes are core collections that they are always found as representatives of ancient China in modern museums both in China and overseas. This session will describe different categories of bronzes and the motifs found on them in relation to their dates. It will also introduce the imperial collections found in the Kaogu tu, and later on in Xiqing gujian; and explain the values and significance of bronze collections in modern museums. \u00a0\u00a04. Lacquer\u00a0Lacquer is a unique production of ancient China. This session introduces the complicated steps involved in its production, and reviews lacquer-using history in China and in other parts of Asia. The discussion leads student to become aware of the broad transmission of the lacquer-using traditions in Asia that shaped a central role for China in antiquity.\u00a0\u00a05. Sculpture\u00a0In China, sculptural representation is closely tied with religious practices. This session will introduce the Buddhist sites in Henan and Sichuan, as well as the pictorial representations found in the Daoist temples in Hebei. The session will describe the renewed definition of sculpture in the modern times when the Western artistic values were received.\u00a0\u00a06. Architecture\u00a0Architecture forms an essential part of material culture. In China, however, the studies of historical architecture began rather late. This session introduces the classic writings by Liang Sicheng, as well as the renowned Yingcao fasi, the Building Manual composed in the Song period, which founded the standardized Chinese construction works. \u00a0\u00a07. Silk\u00a0Silk production began in the late Neolithic period. This session introduces the traditional steps in silk-making and weaving as found in craftsman handbooks published in the Ming period; and discusses how silk as commodity embodies the rich history of cultural exchange between China and the West through trade.\u00a0\u00a08. Ceramics\u00a0Ceramics are representative productions of south China. This session introduces the production of the classic kilns of Ge, Yu, Ding, Longquan, and Jingdezhen. This session instructs students to identify the colour, texture, decoration, as well as motifs found on the ceramics produced in different areas. They embody rich aesthetic values deemed appropriate in Confucian classics.\u00a0\u00a09. Ornaments\u00a0Chinese ornaments comprise an extended family of motifs that include flowers, birds, figures, beasts, characters, as well as scenes. This session discuss two key groups: plants and dragons. The former was adopted from both nature and religious practices; whereas the latter was acquired through cultural construction over time. This session discusses how the two genres merged along difference courses into what we understand as being Chinese today. \u00a0\u00a010. Chinese calligraphy and paintings\u00a0Chinese calligraphy and paintings represent a major aesthetic system that includes the use of ink and brush, writing, as well as imagination particularly defined in Daoist writings. This session introduces the basic concepts of calligraphy and the features found in the classic paintings from the Song to the Qing periods. \u00a0\u00a011. Grave goods: objects for the deceased \u00a0Mingqi is a unique category of items produced in China. It is a group of goods created especially for the burial with the deceased that they are closely connected with the Chinese ideas about ghosts, spirits, and afterlife. This session will review the history of mingqi from as early as the Bronze Age, and look into how this understanding is translated in modern practice.\u00a0\u00a012. Antique collection and modern consumerism\u00a0The antiquities of China provide a resourceful base for modern designers and cultural industries. In light of modern consuming practices, Chinese designers, architects, museum workers, historians, and other culture-related professionals fall back on inheritance to seek for ideas to create something new and unique for the country. This session reviews the concerns of relevant practitioners. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion \u00a0The concluding session outline the present ideas about material culture and its role in modern society, which is a topic that has become increasingly important in the spheres of anthropology and sociology. This session will combine the discussions on Chinese material culture and the discourse of object studies. This will give students ideas to develop interests in the study of China; and enable them to engage the past with the present.", "required_readings": "Primary textbooks\u00a0i. Dant, Tim.

Do these thoughts and emotions support the real purpose of our life, bringing fulfillment and happiness? Or do they make our life an endless cycle of stress, anger, fear, and even hopelessness? The course offers an orientation into mindfulness meditation as a possible way of \u201cresetting,\u201d at personal and inter-personal levels. Emphasis is on reflective participation, supplemented by knowledge of basic concepts and principles.From the formal practice of sitting cross-legged and quietly counting the breaths to the informal practice of embracing each moment in daily life, students will be guided to cultivate samma sati, or \u201cright mindfulness,\u201d one of the Eightfold Paths to end suffering. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is grounded in ancient Buddhist sutras named Anapanasati (\u201cmindfulness breathing\u201d) and Satipatthana (\u201cfoundation of mindfulness\u201d) and 2,500 years of lay and monastic practice. It aims for the practitioner to develop one-pointed concentration on the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas (phenomena), and thereby to reflect on their impermanence, comprehend no-self, and cultivate loving kindness. Over the past decades, a whole range of secular mindfulness practices, or mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have emerged to serve therapeutic and educational purposes. Students may also explore one or more of such modern applications, and ponder the contribution of mindfulness training to good health and well-being (Sustainable Development Goal 3), and to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a whole.The course will take students on a one-week retreat in a Buddhist meditation centre, preceded by readings and presentations on relevant topics, and followed by a personal reflection and a mini-research on the experience. Through undisturbed practice of mindfulness meditation away from home and along with peers and monastics, students will master the basic skills of the formal practice and begin to develop a habit of mindful living. Hopefully, they will cultivate a sense of self-compassion and connectedness with fellow human beings that fosters emotion management, harmonious relation and wise social action.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2306", "title": "Religious Art of China", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED2306 is double-coded with FAAS2110. \nNot for Fine Arts Majors; and students who have taken FAAS2110. \nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "(UGED2306 is double-coded with FAAS2110.)

In the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should \u201c\u5916\u5e2b\u9020\u5316\uff0c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5fc3\u6e90\u201d (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the \u201cheart-source\u201d of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field\u2019s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like \u201c\u6c23\u97fb\u751f\u52d5\u201d (infusing ch\u2019i to show life movement) or \u201c\u610f\u8da3\u201d (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their \u201cheart-source\u201d. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting \u201ctranslates\u201d the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists\u2019 cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the \u201cheart-source\u201d of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies.

This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.", "outcome": "\u00a0 1.

After examining some basic educational concepts and ideals concerning the nature and values of education, the course will focus on aims of education as embedded in the educational practice of cultivating desirable human qualities in educated persons, moving from general themes (in Part 1) to special themes (in Part 2), built-in with a series of workshops on thinking through reading and writing\u300c\u8b80\u5beb\u9032\u601d\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u300d'RAW Thinking Workshop' based on 'CAROL' method (employing the ACCESS approach for thinking \u300c\u516d\u7dad\u56db\u9ad4\u9032\u601d\u6cd5\u300ddeveloped by Roger Cheng).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Students are expected to:\u00a0(1)\u00a0\u00a0 Be able to thoughtfully think about how to tackle three fundamental questions concerning the nature, values and aims of education: (a) what is education?

These scenarios may include but are not limited to organ donation, resuscitation of a terminally ill loved one, withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for an end-of-life patient, active euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as well as healthcare rationing. While a well-established legal and health system can provide guidelines for walking through these processes, the values and beliefs of the patients, healthcare workers, and other decision-makers (including family members and guardians) would shape the way decisions are made. Therefore, understanding the factors that may shape or influence one\u2019s values and moral beliefs is crucial for any meaningful discussions to resolve these dilemmas. This course will use a systematic approach to guide students in understanding the moral theories and principles pertinent to the works of bioethics, identifying the morally salient features and arguments of selected clinical, healthcare, and health-related scenarios, discussing and analyzing the main bioethical issues of those scenarios, as well as describing ways to resolve the relevant moral dilemma. Students will be introduced to different simulation exercises and scenarios to realize and reflect on the factors that shape their own decisions as well as moral values and beliefs.

The basis of moral status, and why human beings are considered to possess moral status form the foundation of the study of bioethics.\u00a0 As human beings are agreed to possess full moral status, this introductory lecture will engage students in a reflection on what humans are by nature, and how human is viewed from the moral perspective, i.e. what are the specific human features that ground human moral status. 2.\u00a0Moral theories: Consequentialist utilitarianism (the consequence of an action e.g. the number of lives that matters most morally) vs. Categorical deontology (the universal principle of the duty of the action itself that matters more morally) using classic trolleyology as example: what matters more? The strengths and limitations of the two main traditional moral theories. 3.\u00a0Moral theories: Principlism.\u00a0Recognize the origin of the 4 pillars of principlism. Identify the bioethical issues and features of scenarios in the medical and healthcare settings. Learn the principlist method to resolve the moral dilemmas identified among the four principles in different scenarios. Recognize the deficiency and limitations of principlism in resolving moral dilemmas - why principlism necessary but inadequate in addressing the dilemma of life and death issues in the public health and healthcare settings. (e.g. Who to save? Decision-making under limited healthcare resources.Treat or not treat? Life-sustaining and standard curative treatments for end-of-life and terminally ill patients.) 4.\u00a0Real life bioethical scenarios in Hong Kong and around the world.\u00a0Start a conversation: the pressing healthcare-related issues in Hong Kong (end-of-life care, organ donation, advanced therapies, Hong Kong Genome Project). Present some landmark and relevant local and international cases of bioethics in clinical and healthcare settings. Illustrate and analyze the moral dilemma and their respective bioethical arguments. Describe means of resolution of these conflicts.\u00a0 5.\u00a0Moral theories: Virtue ethics and character development.\u00a0From social psychology to bioethics: Milgrim Experiment. Does virtue exist in human beings or is it relative? Is pursuing virtue a meaningful project for human beings? Does character matter in bioethics? Describe the relevance of virtue and character to bioethics, power imbalance and coercion, bioethics in experiments and clinical trials (e.g. new drugs for a terminally ill patient), the importance of informed consent and the right to withdraw. 6.\u00a0Beyond reasons in bioethics: Emotions, intuitions, experience, and relationships. Hume\u2019s Sentimentalism as a moral theory (is moral decision governed by emotion or reason more?). How sentimentalism, intuition, experience and relationships influence decision-making in bioethics and healthcare settings. Who to save? Should relationship and feelings matter? Reviewing \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d scenario. Case discussion: organ transplant, resuscitation of terminally ill loved ones/family members, body donation. 7.\u00a0Beyond traditional moral theories in bioethics: Non-Western, religion, care, narrative, and feminist ethics.\u00a0Non-Western ethics: a summary of how Confucianism or other non-Western ethics (e.g. African bioethics) approach bioethical issues. Medical care against cultural or religious beliefs (Jehovah witness, non-therapeutic infant male circumcision).\u00a0Care ethics: Case-based perspective vs principle-based perspective.\u00a0Narrative ethics: An alternative but necessary method to bring particularity and lived experience into bioethics. Feminist ethics: is ethics gendered?\u00a0 How does feminist perspective contribute to understanding the pluralism of bioethics?\u00a0\u00a0 8.\u00a0Living in a pluralistic world of bioethics: Perspectives vs foundational approach to bioethics.\u00a0Monism vs. Pluralism: why we need to approach bioethics in a pluralistic manner? The limitations of monistic approach to bioethics. Why and how we should approach bioethics using different perspectives and lenses. \u00a0 Tutorials:\u00a0 1.\u00a0Decision-making in healthcare settings (with simulation exercise):\u00a0An introduction to how the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice are relevant and featured in healthcare scenarios. Identify the moral dilemmas in the scenarios, and reflect on the rationale behind the decisions.\u00a0 2.\u00a0Moral decision-making of life and death matters (with simulation exercise to inform AI decision making):\u00a0Moral Machine Exercise of Automated Car. Identify and reflect on feelings, sentiments as well as reasoning that go into the decision-making process. Recognize personal values and what shape one\u2019s moral decision regarding life and death matters. 3.\u00a0Case study: Bringing it all together:\u00a0Use case study to illustrate how a pluralistic approach to bioethics works. \u00a0 Glossary/Notes:  Care ethics: How about the genuine care and concerns for other people and living beings?  Feminist ethics: Can we treat the moral theories available not as foundations but different perspectives?\u00a0\u00a0  Minority ethics: What about the moral concerns of the minority?  Narrative ethics: How about the stories and experiences behind people\u2019s decisions?\u00a0  Principlism: Moral theories that are based on one single principle seems to be too narrow\u2026 how about one that has four?  Trolleyology: stems from the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d or \u201ctrolley dilemma\u201d invented by the contemporary British philosopher Phillipa Foot in defending the doctrine of double effect (the morality of killing to save the life of others). Trolleyology is an evolved version of the trolley problem with scenarios that trigger different moral considerations behind judgment and a chosen action.

However, the humanities have the potential to help us understand and transform how we view and relate to the natural world. This course explores environmental issues from an interdisciplinary perspective integrating philosophy and the arts.The first part of the course addresses central issues in environmental philosophy and ethics. We will examine (a) the concepts of nature and environment; (b) the relationship between the human being and its environment, between culture and nature; and (c) the Anthropocene, the geological epoch in which human activity is the primary factor shaping environmental change. We then turn to environmental ethics, asking what moral responsibilities we have to non-human living beings and ecosystems. We conclude the first part of the course with a discussion of the aesthetic value of nature. In the second part of the course, we will examine the role of the arts (especially literature, visual art, and film) in shaping our relationship with the natural world and motivating climate action. We will apply concepts from environmental philosophy and humanities to develop a deeper appreciation and critical understanding of environmental artworks, with a focus on work from Hong Kong artists. Throughout the course, experiential learning activities will give students the chance to see how transforming our understanding and relationship with nature can improve our overall well-being.This course bears on several of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will see how work in the humanities and arts can motivate climate action (SDG#13 Climate Action). By reimagining our relationship with the environment and the connections between nature and culture, we can envision more sustainable ways of life in a heavily urbanized space like Hong Kong (SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities). And by transforming our attitude towards and relationship with nature, we enjoy the mental health benefits of a deepened appreciation of and connection with nature (SDG#3 Good Health and Well-Being).

This course revolves around the distinctive rhythms, experiences, and dynamics of urban life. What gives urban living its distinct characteristics? What current social, economic, and political problems deserve the attention of urban inhabitants? Which issues generate the greatest discord and motivate full coordination among different actors involved in governing cities? As urban life is characterized by both cosmopolitan conviviality and immense inequality, in this course students will learn about different modes of coexistence and exclusion in contemporary cities. Globalizing forms of urban protest arising from struggles over urban resources, space, and decision-making mechanisms will be investigated. By highlighting the complex and contested dynamics of urban life, the course will help students situate and interpret their everyday urban experiences at the intersection of multiple and interconnected flows, networks, and scales that are produced by the city and that produce it.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2923", "title": "Exploring Sign Languages and Deaf Communities", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Discussion\nLecture\nProject\nInteractive Tutorial\nWorkshop", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "Not for Linguistic Majors.\nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "The course aims to introduce to students conceptions and misconceptions about sign language and deaf community.

Selected references in sociology, psychology, religion and literature will be introduced to provide a board intellectual perspective to understand the complex relationships between self and society. Students are expected to acquire an ability to analyze and critique on how different social institutions such as education, religion, family, media, work, consumerism, state, etc., affect our attitude and behaviors in some essential issues of life such as mate choice. Following the tradition of critical theory, this course assumes that this reflection is the first step for liberating from \"bad faith\" and living an authentic life. Through reflection on experience that affects them most, students are encouraged to critically examine sustainability issues concerning the well-beings of young people (topic 1, 2, 3 and SDG3), quality of education (topic 4 and SDG4), sustainability in the workplace (topic 5 and SDG8) and inequalities in the local context (topic 3, 4, 5 and SDG10).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2980", "title": "Meanings of Life", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED2980 is double-coded with ANTH2350. \nNot for Anthropology Majors; and students who have taken ANTH2350.\nCo-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "(UGED2980 is double-coded with ANTH2350.)

In 21st century post-colonial Hong Kong, the preservation of \u2018collective memory\u2019 of this fast-changing city has become an everyday discourse. From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of \u2018the past\u2019. This act of remembering and exploring \u2018our history\u2019 questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity \u2014 personal, collective, and spatial \u2014 in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong\u2019s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites\u2019 households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women\u2019s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3208", "title": "Love and Intimate Relationship", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nProject\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED3208 is double-coded with GDRS3004. \nNot for Gender Studies Majors; and students who have taken GDRS3004. \nCo-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "(UGED3208 is double-coded with GDRS3004.)

Coupling biochemistry\u2019s knowledge of mental illness with self-reflections, students are expected to develop a critical and comprehensive understanding of mental illness and mental health. With the use of experiential exercises, case studies, and film viewing, students will be further encouraged to scrutinize mental health issues in their daily lives. As there is a growing number of individuals challenged by mental illnesses both locally and internationally, students will have high chance of encountering an individual with mental illnesses in their social circles, workplaces or even family in the future. The development of a comprehensive and critical view towards mental illnesses will definitely prepare them to face this future challenge.[All students will be required to plan and organize a compulsory experiential learning activity for service users at a mental health agency/setting during Reading Week.
