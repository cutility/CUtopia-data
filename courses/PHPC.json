Students can gain first-hand experiences and grasp certain practical skills by conducting the field studies in Hong Kong, China and other areas. Environmental health is about how the environmental factors may adversely impact the public health and what we can do to prevent or minimize these impacts. By the scale, the hazards can be local (e.g., industrial and household pollution, traffic exhaust), regional (e.g., deteriorating regional air quality), or global (e.g., climate change); by the relationship to social development, the hazards can be traditional (e.g., household hygiene) or modern (e.g., new chemicals). Without field studies, the students may have difficulties in understand the broad scopes of environmental health practice. This course is to fill in this gap by conducting local and regional field studies and equipping the students with practical skills (e.g., air sampling techniques) in environmental monitoring, risk assessment and management. Students are first required to select a study topic of interest, for example air pollution and respiratory diseases, water pollution and metal industry, and social development and sustainability, and then to review literature, to collect information from the places visited, and to write up a final report.This course will be held during term breaks under the supervision of one or more faculty members. Students are responsible for all travel expenses in the field study, including transportation, food, accommodation, and travel insurance.The objectives of the course are three-fold: (1) to offer students a field-based education early in their undergraduate programs for the extension of classroom learning through direct observation and experience; (2) to deepen students\u2019 understanding on relationships between environment and health, with emphasis on pollution, social development, and sustainability; and (3) to provide students a comprehensive view on local and regional public health issues.", "outcome": "By the end of this course, the students should be able to:\u00a0\u00a0\u2022Acquire basic knowledge and practical skills on how to obtain, process and organize information in environmental monitoring, risk assessment and management\u00a0\u2022Apply scientific methods and public health theories to real-world issues and scenario observed in the field study \u00a0\u2022Apply critical thinking skill, written, oral communication and presentation skill to effectively synthesize a cogent argument in environmental health", "syllabus": "Lecture on local pollution and health problems; Site visit to local industry , e.g. plastic factory, cement plan; Lecture on water pollution and health sustainability in urban areas; Site visit to local automatic ambient air monitoring stations; Site visit to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and local hospitals Lecture on health impact of hazardous waste; Site visit to local hazardous waste management centre", "required_readings": "Robin A.
