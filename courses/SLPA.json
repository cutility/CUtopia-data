Students will learn to apply these concepts and ideas to tackle linguistic problems.", "outcome": "Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\u00a01. Classify speech sounds according to articulatory criteria; \u00a02. Use phonetic transcription to learn the pronunciation of new words; \u00a03.
