It also presents key concepts and examples on remote sensing applications in Earth system science, such as the (atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere), and global changes. This course also provides computer-based lab exercises that facilitate the understanding of remote sensing principles and the processing of remote sensing data.", "outcome": "This course will contribute to understanding of basic concepts and principles of remote sensing at optical and microwave frequencies from airborne and spaceborne platforms. With the help from laboratory analysis and case studies, remote sensing applications in Earth system science can be further understood. The students will develop: 1) the ability to evaluate an issue critically based on evidence and scientific principle, 2) to acquire knowledge effectively by self-study and using information technology, and to work independently, 3) to work effectively in a team, and 4) to present information in a clear, concise and logical manner.
