Wars have also driven immense changes in human society itself, often far beyond the original intentions of political and military leaders. This dynamic has had a powerful effect on the history of the Western world, shaping the development of Western states as we know them today.This course will introduce students to the military history of the medieval West (c. AD 500-1500), focusing on Europe and surrounding regions of North Africa and Western Asia. Through weekly lectures, readings, and discussions, you will learn about key developments in military technology and tactics, as well as the decisive wars and battles in which they were put to the test.", "outcome": "1.

With our emphasis on critical thinking, essay writing, and primary source interpretation, not only will students be profoundly better informed as to the subject matter and demonstrably more expert on matters of historical investigation; you will also leave with an enhanced set of skills. After successfully completing the coursework, students will be better able to express ideas clearly in writing, to conduct scholarly research, to analyze information and to critique differing viewpoints, to compare and to contrast contrary cases of historical interpretation, to discern and to explain the links between historical events, and to assess the importance of historical documents or of cultural artifacts whether they comprise a political cartoon, book, painting, speech, song, or film.", "syllabus": "Our course will stand true to its name and explore modern American history rather than recount it. We will take a thematic rather than a progressive line of inquiry and essentially sacrifice the comforts of an orderly timeline for the challenges of a non-linear exploration. Chronology will not be eliminated as the lectures will roughly flow from the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries and the events and the movements we investigate will be placed in their temporal contexts, but we will be most interested in the links between different periods with regards to specific subjects. The weekly lecture topics include economics; territorial expansion; popular movements that originated outside government structures and the influence they later wielded within them; the betrayal, confrontations, and confinement of Native Americans; slavery and institutionalized bigotry; religion and popular culture; urban development; the causes of and responses to economic impoverishment; international relations; and crises of authority.

In particular, the course examines how monuments/heritage sites, alongside museums, etc., function as gatekeepers of historical knowledge and as channels of social memory. The course, thus, breaks down dynamics (both local and global) that contribute to public debate about the past. In amalgamating knowledge of representations of the past with the development of skills in historical methodology, theory, and practice, students can expand cognisance as to how public history is represented, constructed, debated and, at times, contested. By possessing new critical awareness and skills students will be better able to sense and value the variety of roles played by historians in public settings, and the significance and impact too of public history upon culture, politics, and society at large.", "outcome": "The course is designed with the following learning outcomes:\u00a01. To introduce students to critical issues in public history so that they can recognise the variety of ways/the changing ways the public engages with the past;2. To offer an interdisciplinary study of public representations of the past, and engagement with the past, by means of the analysing monuments in public spaces (e.g. in Hong Kong and elsewhere);3. To explore how history is represented, debated, and contested in the domain of public spaces, and in associated settings such as museums, the media, etc.;4. To visit monuments in Hong Kong so as to understand how they function as conduits of social memory;5. To present opportunity for academic training via the development of historical methods and independent research so that learners can meaningfully engage with issues surrounding national narratives, contested histories, collective memory, and commemoration.\u00a0\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u9810\u8a08\u9054\u5230\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c\uff1a1. \u4e86\u89e3\u516c\u773e\u6b77\u53f2\u5b78\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u660e\u767d\u516c\u773e\u5982\u4f55\u8655\u7406\u904e\u53bb\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u8655\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8b8a\u30022. \u5f9e\u8de8\u5b78\u79d1\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u9593\u88e1\u70ba\u7d00\u5ff5\u800c\u8a2d\u7684\u5efa\u7bc9\uff0c\u660e\u767d\u793e\u6703\u5982\u4f55\u518d\u73fe\u904e\u53bb\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8655\u7406\u904e\u53bb3. \u660e\u767d\u6b77\u53f2\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u9593\u5167\uff08\u516c\u5171\u5834\u6240\u3001\u535a\u7269\u9928\u3001\u5a92\u9ad4\uff09\u518d\u73fe\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u5099\u53d7\u722d\u8b70\u548c\u722d\u596a4. \u53c3\u89c0\u9999\u6e2f\u5883\u5167\u70ba\u7d00\u5ff5\u800c\u8a2d\u7684\u5efa\u7bc9\uff0c\u660e\u767d\u5b83\u5011\u5982\u4f55\u6210\u70ba\u793e\u6703\u8a18\u61b6\u7684\u7ba1\u90535. \u638c\u63e1\u7d2e\u5be6\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u5b78\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u9032\u884c\u7368\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c31\u570b\u65cf\u6b77\u53f2\u3001\u96c6\u9ad4\u8a18\u61b6\u3001\u7d00\u5ff5\u6d3b\u52d5\u7b49\u554f\u984c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u770b\u6cd5", "syllabus": "Week 1.

The course places emphasis on social, political and economic aspects of ancient China and major social transitions reflected in material cultures in order to complement the missing of textual records. We will examine a variety of themes through the lens of material culture engaged with primary and secondary textual sources. We cover the period between the transition of Neolithic and early domestication until the end of the Qin Empire. The main focus is on understanding how we can reconstruct various aspects of ancient China through the analysis and interpretation of material culture.Important themes covered in the class include the origin and foundation of early civilization, the formation of early state, urbanism, divination and state-sponsored ritual, trade and core-periphery relations, craft industry and technological change, the emergence of state bureaucracies, and the process of political unification. The course will provide students a basic understanding of these topics in the contexts of early China as understand through the material culture of ancient Chinese societies in juxtaposition with early textual sources including oracle bone inscription and bronze inscriptions. Weekly tutorial sections will focus on the implications and significance of these themes.", "outcome": "After taking this course, students are expected to:\u00a0\u2022 Analyze the formation process of civilization and major transformative social changes in ancient China.\u00a0\u2022 Understand how archaeologists reconstruct the history of \u201cprehistory\u201d through archaeological records.\u00a0\u2022 Critically evaluation the strength and limitation in archaeological research.\u00a0\u2022 Discuss how archaeological records can be productively supplement textual evidence in historical research.\u00a0\u2022 Understand the legacy of big social changes and impacts of ancient China in present-day societies.\u00a0\u2022 Cultivate the abilities of cross-cultural, inter-disciplinary and critical thinking.\u00a0\u00a0\u9810\u671f\u9054\u5230\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u76ee\u7684\u5305\u62ec:\u00a0- \u5206\u6790\u65e9\u671f\u4e2d\u570b\u6587\u660e\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u904e\u7a0b\u548c\u91cd\u5927\u793e\u6703\u8f49\u6298\u00a0- \u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u8003\u53e4\u6750\u6599\u91cd\u5efa\u201c\u53f2\u524d\u53f2\u201d\u00a0- \u5c0d\u8003\u53e4\u7814\u7a76\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u4e4b\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u00a0- \u5728\u6b77\u53f2\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u8003\u53e4\u8cc7\u6599\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8f14\u52a9\u6587\u737b\u7814\u7a76\u00a0- \u65e9\u671f\u4e2d\u570b\u5728\u7576\u4ee3\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6df1\u9060\u5f71\u97ff\u00a0- \u8de8\u6587\u5316\u8207\u8de8\u5b78\u79d1\u4e4b\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u529b", "syllabus": "- Introduction: Basics of ancient Chinese geography, environment, chronology, and approach to material culture\u00a0- Neolithic evolution and early agriculture\u00a0- Late Neolithic and the dawn of civilization\u00a0- Xia and Early Shang: State formation and the imperial expansion\u00a0- Late Shang I: The first bureaucratic system and metropolis? \u00a0- Late Shang II: Craft production system in the Bronze Age\u00a0- Late Shang III: Central and periphery relationship and goods exchange\u00a0- Western Zhou I: Feudal state or territorial state? \u00a0- Western Zhou II: Ritual reform and social impacts\u00a0- Springs and Autumns: the waning of the Zhou order\u00a0- Warring States I: Urbanism and rise of iron technology \u00a0- Warring States II: The emergence of imperial states \u00a0- Qin unification and the legacy of ancient China \u00a0\u00a0- \u5c0e\u8ad6: \u53e4\u4ee3\u4e2d\u570b\uff1a\u5e74\u4ee3\u5b78\u8207\u7269\u8cea\u6587\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u00a0 - \u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u9769\u547d\u8207\u65e9\u671f\u8fb2\u696d\u00a0 - \u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u665a\u671f\u8207\u6587\u660e\u7684\u8a95\u751f\u00a0 - \u590f\u8207\u65e9\u5546\uff1a\u570b\u5bb6\u5f62\u6210\u8207\u64f4\u5f35\u00a0 - \u665a\u5546 i: \u6700\u65e9\u7684\u5b98\u50da\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u90fd\u5e02?\u00a0 - \u665a\u5546 ii: \u9752\u9285\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u696d\u751f\u7522\u00a0 - \u665a\u5546 iii: \u4e2d\u5fc3-\u908a\u7de3\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u63db \u00a0 - \u897f\u5468 i: \u5c01\u5efa\u570b\u5bb6\u6216\u5ee3\u57df\u570b\u5bb6?\u00a0 - \u897f\u5468 ii: \u79ae\u5236\u6539\u9769\u8207\u793e\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u00a0 - \u6625\u79cb: \u7269\u8cea\u6587\u5316\u6240\u898b\u7684\u897f\u5468\u79e9\u5e8f\u7684\u74e6\u89e3\u00a0 - \u6230\u570b i: \u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u8207\u9435\u5668\u6280\u8853\u00a0 - \u6230\u570b ii: \u5e1d\u570b\u7684\u51fa\u73fe\u00a0 - \u79e6\u4e4b\u7d71\u4e00\u8207\u5f71\u97ff", "required_readings": "Gideon, Shelach-Lavi. 2015.

This comparative studies programme shall allow students to obtain a critical understanding of the nature of industrial society through fostering a multidisciplinary approach to industrialisation and many of the changes in society it helped to establish. The course will give students the opportunity to consider the ideas and the conditions in Europe and elsewhere that produced industrial change, capitalism and democracy \u2013 processes that the West considered then and still considers today as desirable for itself and other parts of the world. The curriculum gives particular focus to pre-industrial Europe and its economy, industrial Britain, urbanisation and its effects upon social classes, public health, housing and ways of living. The course is designed to build skills such as thinking critically, well-constructed writing and the clear presenting of oral arguments.

We will employ a hybrid chronological and thematic approach to explore the personal experience of women as well as the contexts of society and politics in different times that women lived in. We will discuss the agency of women not merely as passive observers but at times as contributors to shape history. We will read scholarly materials and examine primary sources of memoirs, autobiographies, biographies, and oral history accounts. We will focus not only on those who are known in history, but also on ordinary individuals whose lives were affected, changed, destroyed, interrupted, empowered, and inspired by the forces of history. We will examine both the powerful and the powerless, and the power of the powerless to affect their own destiny. The course will employ a flipped classroom approach with an aim to cultivate community, collaboration, and creativity.

This era saw great changes of social and political theory: a ritual life that had reached from emperor into villages came to be articulated in relation to a central government and its cities. The rural population ceased to be central to ritual life and came to be marginalized. Orthodox values came to be looked upon as superstition. Meanwhile, a social ethos came to represent the fashion of a new age, and city life was looked upon as a symbol of progress. This transition from old to new repositioned the individual, family, nation, and even language and gender. This transition has continued to the present day, making us as much its creator as well as its product.

It focuses on the forces that have led to the development of cities in the past, and achieves this through the lens of a multi-disciplinary perspective and the utilisation of various methodologies. Such a standpoint is adopted in order to allow for the exploration of the impacts of matters like politics, economics, culture and identity, art and architecture, intellectual thought, law, transportation, and military technology upon urban society at different times in history, and to recognise how they influenced the design and shape of the built environment, and so city living. Central to the programme is the use of comparative analyses which assist in identifying and contrasting patterns of urban change. As such differences in urban design that became evident in the past will be made clear. Furthermore such an approach helps illuminate and clarify the imprint upon urban space and the urban mind of agents affecting the urban development process, including visions and concepts (built and unbuilt) that have swayed social development. Importantly too in utilising this analytical perspective students are granted opportunities to test hypotheses under the guidance of their teacher about the causes and effects of urban transition, in so doing helping explicitly comprehend the narrative of historical urban development in both factual and conceptual terms.", "outcome": "1.

The course will explore the relations between domestic politics and foreign policy, geo-political and ideological confrontations, the race to spread the gospels of democracy and the hunt for wealth; indeed, discrepancies between the image and reality in international relations.
