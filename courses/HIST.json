During these 200 years, as a continent Europe achieved its height in military, cultural, and commercial power; it then engaged in a period of violent self-destruction; finally, after profound ideological and territorial division, it reinvented itself. How the scope and volatility of the changes brought about during this time manifested themselves in the lives of ordinary men, women, and children, as well as in the affairs among nations, will receive due attention.

Utilizing innovative teaching methods to enable students to critically understand the physical as well as cultural character of the city, and so the nation at large, a multidisciplinary approach is fostered so as to encourage learners to recognize and explain factors that have influenced Philippines civilization as it progressed from the \u201ctraditional\u201d to the \u201cmodern\u201d. Encouraging learners too to identify connections between the country and places elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, ultimately the course places the evolution of life in the Philippine Archipelago within the greater Asia-Pacific region.

The course places emphasis on social, political and economic aspects of ancient China and major social transitions reflected in material cultures in order to complement the missing of textual records. We will examine a variety of themes through the lens of material culture engaged with primary and secondary textual sources. We cover the period between the transition of Neolithic and early domestication until the end of the Qin Empire. The main focus is on understanding how we can reconstruct various aspects of ancient China through the analysis and interpretation of material culture.Important themes covered in the class include the origin and foundation of early civilization, the formation of early state, urbanism, divination and state-sponsored ritual, trade and core-periphery relations, craft industry and technological change, the emergence of state bureaucracies, and the process of political unification. The course will provide students a basic understanding of these topics in the contexts of early China as understand through the material culture of ancient Chinese societies in juxtaposition with early textual sources including oracle bone inscription and bronze inscriptions. Weekly tutorial sections will focus on the implications and significance of these themes.", "outcome": "After taking this course, students are expected to:\u00a0\u2022 Analyze the formation process of civilization and major transformative social changes in ancient China.\u00a0\u2022 Understand how archaeologists reconstruct the history of \u201cprehistory\u201d through archaeological records.\u00a0\u2022 Critically evaluation the strength and limitation in archaeological research.\u00a0\u2022 Discuss how archaeological records can be productively supplement textual evidence in historical research.\u00a0\u2022 Understand the legacy of big social changes and impacts of ancient China in present-day societies.\u00a0\u2022 Cultivate the abilities of cross-cultural, inter-disciplinary and critical thinking.\u00a0\u00a0\u9810\u671f\u9054\u5230\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u76ee\u7684\u5305\u62ec:\u00a0- \u5206\u6790\u65e9\u671f\u4e2d\u570b\u6587\u660e\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u904e\u7a0b\u548c\u91cd\u5927\u793e\u6703\u8f49\u6298\u00a0- \u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u8003\u53e4\u6750\u6599\u91cd\u5efa\u201c\u53f2\u524d\u53f2\u201d\u00a0- \u5c0d\u8003\u53e4\u7814\u7a76\u512a\u9ede\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u4e4b\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u00a0- \u5728\u6b77\u53f2\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u8003\u53e4\u8cc7\u6599\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8f14\u52a9\u6587\u737b\u7814\u7a76\u00a0- \u65e9\u671f\u4e2d\u570b\u5728\u7576\u4ee3\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6df1\u9060\u5f71\u97ff\u00a0- \u8de8\u6587\u5316\u8207\u8de8\u5b78\u79d1\u4e4b\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u529b", "syllabus": "- Introduction: Basics of ancient Chinese geography, environment, chronology, and approach to material culture\u00a0- Neolithic evolution and early agriculture\u00a0- Late Neolithic and the dawn of civilization\u00a0- Xia and Early Shang: State formation and the imperial expansion\u00a0- Late Shang I: The first bureaucratic system and metropolis? \u00a0- Late Shang II: Craft production system in the Bronze Age\u00a0- Late Shang III: Central and periphery relationship and goods exchange\u00a0- Western Zhou I: Feudal state or territorial state? \u00a0- Western Zhou II: Ritual reform and social impacts\u00a0- Springs and Autumns: the waning of the Zhou order\u00a0- Warring States I: Urbanism and rise of iron technology \u00a0- Warring States II: The emergence of imperial states \u00a0- Qin unification and the legacy of ancient China \u00a0\u00a0- \u5c0e\u8ad6: \u53e4\u4ee3\u4e2d\u570b\uff1a\u5e74\u4ee3\u5b78\u8207\u7269\u8cea\u6587\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u00a0 - \u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u9769\u547d\u8207\u65e9\u671f\u8fb2\u696d\u00a0 - \u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u665a\u671f\u8207\u6587\u660e\u7684\u8a95\u751f\u00a0 - \u590f\u8207\u65e9\u5546\uff1a\u570b\u5bb6\u5f62\u6210\u8207\u64f4\u5f35\u00a0 - \u665a\u5546 i: \u6700\u65e9\u7684\u5b98\u50da\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u90fd\u5e02?\u00a0 - \u665a\u5546 ii: \u9752\u9285\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u696d\u751f\u7522\u00a0 - \u665a\u5546 iii: \u4e2d\u5fc3-\u908a\u7de3\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u63db \u00a0 - \u897f\u5468 i: \u5c01\u5efa\u570b\u5bb6\u6216\u5ee3\u57df\u570b\u5bb6?\u00a0 - \u897f\u5468 ii: \u79ae\u5236\u6539\u9769\u8207\u793e\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u00a0 - \u6625\u79cb: \u7269\u8cea\u6587\u5316\u6240\u898b\u7684\u897f\u5468\u79e9\u5e8f\u7684\u74e6\u89e3\u00a0 - \u6230\u570b i: \u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u8207\u9435\u5668\u6280\u8853\u00a0 - \u6230\u570b ii: \u5e1d\u570b\u7684\u51fa\u73fe\u00a0 - \u79e6\u4e4b\u7d71\u4e00\u8207\u5f71\u97ff", "required_readings": "Gideon, Shelach-Lavi. 2015.

We will discuss the agency of women not merely as passive observers but at times as contributors to shape history. We will read scholarly materials and examine primary sources of memoirs, autobiographies, biographies, and oral history accounts. We will focus not only on those who are known in history, but also on ordinary individuals whose lives were affected, changed, destroyed, interrupted, empowered, and inspired by the forces of history. We will examine both the powerful and the powerless, and the power of the powerless to affect their own destiny.

The victory of the Communists in China's civil war in 1949 and the relocation of the Kuomintang Government to Taipei sparked off the dispute over Taiwan's status, which endures to the present day. Now President Chen Shui-bian wants to redefine Taiwan's status as a sovereign, independent country whose name is the Republic of China, while Beijing defines Taiwan as part of China. This course will examine the stand taken on Taiwan by key international actors, in particular the United States, but including Japan and the European Union. It will look at the Taiwan Straits military crises of the 1950s and the role of the United States, the initial strong international support for the KMT government as the sole legal government of all China until the tide turned in 1971, with Beijing replacing Taipei in the United Nations.

The course will explore the relations between domestic politics and foreign policy, geo-political and ideological confrontations, the race to spread the gospels of democracy and the hunt for wealth; indeed, discrepancies between the image and reality in international relations. We will also look into the issues of personality, race, trade and more recently, the development of the mass media and technology in the conduct of foreign policy.

The rural population ceased to be central to ritual life and came to be marginalized. Orthodox values came to be looked upon as superstition. Meanwhile, a social ethos came to represent the fashion of a new age, and city life was looked upon as a symbol of progress. This transition from old to new repositioned the individual, family, nation, and even language and gender. This transition has continued to the present day, making us as much its creator as well as its product.

It focuses on the forces that have led to the development of cities in the past, and achieves this through the lens of a multi-disciplinary perspective and the utilisation of various methodologies. Such a standpoint is adopted in order to allow for the exploration of the impacts of matters like politics, economics, culture and identity, art and architecture, intellectual thought, law, transportation, and military technology upon urban society at different times in history, and to recognise how they influenced the design and shape of the built environment, and so city living. Central to the programme is the use of comparative analyses which assist in identifying and contrasting patterns of urban change. As such differences in urban design that became evident in the past will be made clear. Furthermore such an approach helps illuminate and clarify the imprint upon urban space and the urban mind of agents affecting the urban development process, including visions and concepts (built and unbuilt) that have swayed social development. Importantly too in utilising this analytical perspective students are granted opportunities to test hypotheses under the guidance of their teacher about the causes and effects of urban transition, in so doing helping explicitly comprehend the narrative of historical urban development in both factual and conceptual terms.", "outcome": "1.
