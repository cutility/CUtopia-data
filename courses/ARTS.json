How do technology, capital and state intertwine and contribute to climate changes and environmental crises? How do people in the humanities engage with issues of sustainability and environmental justice in everyday life? This course introduces major concerns in the field of environmental humanities through the lens of China, the \u201cWorld\u2019s Factory\u201d and the most populated country with the second largest economy, whose environmental challenges have great implications for the rest of the world. This course will first survey topics of scientific and technological intervention of our natural world in the Anthropocene era. It then looks at case studies of specific topics such as agricultural sustainability, waste management, water crisis, species extinction, and environmental justice. Each topic will contain one week discussion of the topic\u2019s global manifestations and related debates in China, and one week\u2019s introduction on humanities response to the issues.

Part of the crisis is caused by global trends toward financial and technological capitalism, but the other part of the problem has to be sought in the humanistic disciplines themselves. Over-specialization in research, fragmentation among and within disciplines, the pressure of utilitarian goals (such as grant-getting for faculty promotion and practical job-orientation for students) are but some of the manifestations obvious to all. How to remedy the situation? Short of an institutional overhaul, we might begin from our own academic base, humanities departments under the Faculty of Arts.From an academic point of view, over-specialization in the humanities departments results in scholars working in narrow and isolated fields without interaction with colleagues in other departments and fields. The study of China also suffers from such an academic trend, which results in fragmentary studies of narrowly defined topics that fail to connect with each other and with the larger background. A further problem, particularly evident in some humanities fields, is the over-reliance on Western theory, which is applied to Chinese data without reflection or mediation. Certain theoretical excesses, as exemplified in the work of Michel Foucault and other poststructuralist theorists, have led to a general distrust of the human subject itself. Indeed, even the word \u201chumanities\u201d has lost its meaning. This seminar is designed to explore new ways of making \u201cconnections\u201d or \u201creconnections\u201d across various disciplines and theoretical domains, it is broadly-based by design and all-inclusive in content. It is also intended to serve as a general forum for faculty-student discussion so as to provide a stimulus for humanistic scholarship and future research.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}]
