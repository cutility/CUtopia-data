With the increasingly limited role of government in governance, the ability of policymakers to collaborate with non-state actors across levels and boundaries becomes critical for addressing policy challenges. The course focuses on how collaborative governance can build consensus and deliberative purposes of public policy and governance through studying its formats, process, rationales, concepts and outcomes as well as evaluation of its effectiveness and dilemma.
