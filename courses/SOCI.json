Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from \u201cthe last Colony\u201d of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called \u2018Hong Kong identity\u2019. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders.

Urbanization \u2014 the increase of the share of the population living in cities \u2014 was one of the developments that early sociologists sought to study and explain.

Urban sociology has many sides, but in this course students will learn about four main topics: 1) the distinctive social character of the \u201curban experience,\u201d 2) the economic role of cities within society, 3) the dynamics of investment in urban land and the construction of the \u201cbuilt environment\u201d in cities, and 4) major social problems facing urban areas today including poverty, affordability, safety, and the effects of climate change.

This will touch on phenomena including gentrification and property bubbles.\u00a0\u00a0Part IV: Urban Problems; Whose Solutions?The final four weeks will look at some challenges confronting cities today. How is increasing inquality impacting urban life? How can crises surrounding housing\u00a0availabiliy, control of public space, and climate change be dealt with?

Are these cleavages strengthening or weakening with the transition to advanced industrialism? (c) How frequently do individuals cross occupational or class boundaries? Are educational degrees, social contacts, and \"individual luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions? What other social and institutional forces affect occupational attainment and allocation? (d) How are the lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities of individuals shaped by their class locations? Are there identifiable \"class cultures\" in past and present societies? (e) What types of social processes and state policies serve to maintain or alter racial, ethnic, and sex discrimination in labor markets? Have these forms of discrimination weakened or strengthened with the transition to advanced industrialism? (f) Will stratification systems take on new and distinctive forms in the future?

We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the conflicts between patients and doctors; about the safety of medical treatments and reliability of medical knowledge; about inequality in health and longevity; and about the ever-increasing health care spending. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people\u2019s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating? How should health care systems be organized?", "outcome": "    Untitled Document   1. Students are expected to learn to critically assess biomedicine from sociological perspectives.  2.

From the development of iPhone to the Covid-19 vaccine, ours is a society organized around and even controlled by expert knowledge systems. Meanwhile, science itself also underwent increasingly fiercer attack by outsiders, a typical example being the disagreement on whether the climate change is real. Sociology of scientific knowledge offers us a set of tools to understanding and analyzing these heatedly debated big questions in society today. By critically analyzing science, scientists, and the system of knowledge production that they created and maintained, this course surveys major topics and recent developments in the social studies of science. The arrangement of these topics follows a micro-to-macro sequence: First, the course discusses personal level STEM experiences, such as STEM educational pipeline and STEM job market; then, the course discusses institutional and disciplinary level analysis of how science works and how innovations come about; lastly, the course moves on to society, national, and international level of the impact of science, using examples from the platform economy, the international politics and the global pandemic. By the end of the course, students will develop basic knowledge towards the Technology Facilitation Mechanism for supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, through critically examining the multistakeholder collaboration between scientific community, nation states and other stakeholders in the STI policy cycle.", "outcome": "1. get familiar with major theoretical approaches in sociology of science and sociology of knowledge2. understand what is a novel discovery in science, what defines a science discipline and what is interdisciplinarity3. understand different forms of stratification in STEM pipeline, such as gender, race and global inequalities in becoming a star scientist / most innovative research team4. critically reflect on the knowledge-based, skill-driven economy, with an emphasis on understanding the labor process in the gig economy and other data-intensive industrial sectors (i.e. software programming, AI)5. critically reflect on the public mistrust in science during global crises, such as global warming and the Covid-19 pandemic6. develop relevant knowledge towards the technology facilitation mechanism for supporting the Sustainable Development Goals", "syllabus": "Topic 1: Introduction: What is science, And why should sociologists care?Topic 2: Institutional Sociologies of Science (I) \u00a0Topic 3: Institutional Sociologies of Science (II)Topic 4: Cultural Sociologies of Science (I)Topic 5: Cultural Sociologies of Science (II)Topic 6: The STEM PipelineSDG 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all -Topic 7: Women in ScienceSDG 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all -SDG 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls \u2013Topic 8: Disciplines and InterdisciplinarityTopic 9: Novelty and the Citation Networks ApproachTopic 10: Workers in the Data-Driven Platform EconomySDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all -Topic 11: Science, Modernization, and National DevelopmentSDG 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation -SDG 17 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable DevelopmentTopic 12: Science and the PublicSDG 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages; SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts -\u00a0", "required_readings": "Textbook:Biagioli, Mario.(eds).

Education-related topics covered in this course will include stratification and inequality, school, family, peers, community, rural-urban divide, migration, gender, technology, mental health, mass education, and elite formation, among others. Through studying these topics, we will also discuss how education is connected to individual, community, and national development, such as whether education reduces poverty and promotes social mobility. Readings will not be region-specific but topic-based, covering empirical evidence across the world and representing the typical research questions on a particular topic. By reading and discussing empirical studies throughout the course, students will learn how to discover and analyze the key sociological and practical issues of education both locally and internationally.", "outcome": "1.
