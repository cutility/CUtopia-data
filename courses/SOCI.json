Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from \u201cthe last Colony\u201d of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called \u2018Hong Kong identity\u2019. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders. The question thus has profound impacts on how resources and power are distributed in society, and affects the life chances of individuals, families and society.(Advisory: Not for Sociology Majors.)", "outcome": "        \u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u671f\u671b\u9054\u5230\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e94\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c:  \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5e0c\u671b\u900f\u904e\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b, \u4ee5\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7684\u8996\u91ce\u53bb\u5e6b\u52a9\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u6230\u5f8c\u7d93\u6b77\u904e\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u767c\u5c55, \u653f\u6cbb\u8b8a\u5316, \u53ca\u6587\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u885d\u64ca\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u53ca\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7684\u4e86\u89e3;  2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u80fd\u5920\u5168\u9762\u601d\u8003\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703, \u7d93\u6fdf\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u74b0\u5883\u5f71\u97ff, \u4e26\u660e\u767d\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u69cb\u80cc\u6240\u6d89\u7684\u6b0a\u5229\u8207\u7fa9\u52d9, \u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u8207\u7d93\u6fdf\u8cc7\u6e90\u5206\u914d.  \u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077 (social change) \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u8a0e\u8ad6\u8eab\u4efd. \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u660e\u767d\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u9019\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u904e\u53bb\u534a\u4e16\u7d00\u7684\u793e\u6703\u6539\u8b8a, \u5305\u62ec\u672c\u571f\u5316, \u53bb\u5de5\u696d\u5316, \u7d93\u6fdf\u8f49\u578b, \u5168\u7403\u5316, \u65b0\u4e2d\u7522\u968e\u7d1a\u7684\u8208\u8d77, \u4e3b\u6b0a\u79fb\u4ea4\u7b49\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.  \u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u5b8f\u89c0\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u4e86\u89e3 \u2018\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u2019 \u9019\u500b\u8eab\u4efd\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703\u7d50\u69cb (social structure) \u8207\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u5f71\u97ff; \u4e26\u555f\u767c\u5b78\u751f\u601d\u8003\u2018\u500b\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u2019 (individual identity)\u8207\u7fa4\u9ad4 (groups), \u793e\u5340(communities), \u793e\u6703\u7cfb\u7d71, (systems), \u548c\u5236\u5ea6 (institutions) \u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u900f\u904e\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u5f0f, \u5305\u62ec\u5609\u8cd3\u8b1b\u8005,\u591a\u5a92\u9ad4\u5f71\u97f3\u6559\u6750\u64ad\u653e\u53ca\u8a0e\u8ad6, \u548c\u5c0f\u7d44\u5c08\u984c\u7fd2\u4f5c \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6b77\u53f2, \u7d50\u69cb, \u6587\u5316\u548c\u5728\u9019\u500b\u793e\u6703\u88e1\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u7fa4\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e86\u89e3, \u4ea6\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u4ee5\u8f03\u5168\u9762\u5b8f\u89c0\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u601d\u8003\u554f\u984c.

Do we have freedom to lead a life of our own or has society already chosen the path of life for each of us? These are issues either taken for granted or deliberately avoided in our everyday life. In this course, sociological theories will be introduced to analyse how social institutions in the modern world have affected the meaning and pattern of life.

The size and density of cities turn out to make for distinctive ways of living and interacting.\u00a0\u00a0Part II: Industrial and Post-Industrial Cities\u00a0\u00a0This three-week section will consider the changing economic significance of cities in modern society. Why do particular industries cluster together in cities or neighbourhoods? How is globalization and financialization changing cities? What are the challenges faced by cities in the Global South today?\u00a0\u00a0Part III: Use and Exchange of Urban Space\u00a0\u00a0In these three weeks, the readings and lectures will consider different sociological accounts of the spatial development of urban areas. What are the consequences of the fact that cities are both spaces where people live and work and investment markets for profit-seeking developers? This will touch on phenomena including gentrification and property bubbles.\u00a0\u00a0Part IV: Urban Problems; Whose Solutions?The final four weeks will look at some challenges confronting cities today. How is increasing inquality impacting urban life? How can crises surrounding housing\u00a0availabiliy, control of public space, and climate change be dealt with? Cities are as much sites of struggle as they are of industry and commerce. A major emphasis will be on how different proposed solutions tend to meet unequally the interests of different social groups.", "required_readings": "\u00a0None.\u00a0\u00a0", "recommended_readings": "Bridge, Gary and Sophie Watson.

We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet present-day health care is the flashpoint of many controversies: about the conflicts between patients and doctors; about the safety of medical treatments and reliability of medical knowledge; about inequality in health and longevity; and about the ever-increasing health care spending. This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people\u2019s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating? How should health care systems be organized?", "outcome": "    Untitled Document   1. Students are expected to learn to critically assess biomedicine from sociological perspectives.  2.

This course dissects these issues from a sociological perspective. We ask questions such as: What counts as illness? How do people understand illness? How does illness affect people\u2019s life? Who gets ill and why? What is the role of medical technology in fostering health? Why do doctors and patients have trouble communicating?This course surveys major approaches and areas in the sociological study of health, illness and medicine. The central idea is that we cannot understand the topics of health, illness and medicine simply by looking at the biological phenomena and medical knowledge, but instead, we must also consider a variety of social, political, economic, and cultural forces.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5642", "title": "The Making of Modern Japan", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Sociology", "requirements": "For students in MA Sociology.", "description": "This course analyzes and delineates the sociohistroical invention and construction of seemingly distinctive \"Japanese\" institutions and cultural values shaped by various global forces in the historical process.
