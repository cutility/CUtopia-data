The objective is to understand how space as a cultural phenomenon relates to matters of ideology, social class, nationality, ethnicity and sexuality. The course will investigate the ways in which meaning about space is generated, disseminated and produced through various practices, beliefs and institutions, and how understanding of space is embedded in the political, economic, or social structures within a given culture. Examples of space making and manifestation will be taken from both Hong Kong and overseas.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2005", "title": "Culture and Travel", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "There are two characteristics in culture: regional (space) and accumulative (time), and is the way to acquire various cultural experiences from different space and time.

How are we attracted to their smartness or ridiculousness?How does the media industry construct the stars body and beauty? How does our celebrity culture enrich Hong Kong and the world?Celebrity is a critical feature of (post)modern society, especially in our entertaining-oriented Hong Kong culture. Hong Kong had been influenced by foreign popular icons for many decades, but the affluent city also has its own culture of celebrity. From Elvis Presley and Beatles to Michael Jackson, Madonna and Lady Gaga; Bruce Lee (\u674e\u5c0f\u9f8d) to Jackie Chan (\u6210\u9f8d) and Stephen Chow (\u5468\u661f\u99b3); and even Princess Diana to Joshua Wong (\u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2), \u201cwell known people\u201d of different areas, although not necessarily being stars of popular culture, have varied extent of social signification. This course discusses the phenomenon of modern celebrity and stardom in Hong Kong, traces the historical evolution of the concepts and differences of celebrity and stardom, and uncovers the influences of electronic media to the culture of celebrity. With celebrity as a social, cultural and institutional production, this course extends a critical understanding of \u201cwell known people\u201d with varied image, ideological and contextual analysis.

We will study carefully and critically various forms of representations to the issues of paintings, illustrations, photography, films, television, and video games. We will learn the languages developed for these visual forms, and how ideologies are structured and conveyed through these visual depictions. In this visual age, while we are bombarded with more and more visual information and sensations, we are also effectively deskilled in our capacities as interpretive beings in critically engaging with these visual representations. This course teaches students how to appreciate the rich hermeneutic possibilities inherent in the visual culture and at the same time to be critical of ways that the viewers are rendered vulnerable to be manipulated by the visual images.", "outcome": "Students in this course are expected to learn how our social order and communities are made up of visual languages and expressions. They are also expected to know the ideological and economic links among production, circulation, and consumption in the realm of visual culture. Through an interdisciplinary approach, students would develop a visual literacy, learning that meanings and emotions can be conveyed visually. Students will also develop critical awareness related to issues pertaining to gender, racial, class, and national identities through the studies of visual representations.", "syllabus": "Part I: Visualizing the Real\u00a0\u00a01) The Visual Pursuit of the Real\u00a0Reading:  Nicholas Mirzoeff, An Introduction to Visual Culture, Ch.1\u00a0\u00a02) Realism and Anti-Realism\u00a0Reading: Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright, Practices of Looking, 109-130;\u00a0 Jacques Meuris, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, pp.72\u2013101\u00a0\u00a03) From Lithography to Photography\u00a0Reading:  Susan Sontag, On Photography\u00a0\u00a04) Moving Images\u00a0Reading:  Andr\u00e9 Bazin, What is Cinema? 1, pp. 23\u201340 \u00a0\u00a05) Digital Imaging\u00a0Reading:  Lev Manovich, The Language of New Media, pp. 49\u201361, 293\u2013308\u00a0 Jay David Bolter & Richard Grusin, Remediation, pp. 2\u201315.\u00a0\u00a0Part II: The Politics of Seeing\u00a0\u00a06) Seeing and Subjection\u00a0Reading:  John Berger, Ways of Seeing\u00a0\u00a07) The Ethics of Seeing\u00a0Reading:  Stuart Hall, \u201cThe Spectacle of the 'Other'\u201d in Representation\u00a0\u00a08) Seeing and Modernity\u00a0Readings:  Jonathan Crary, Techniques of the Observers, Ch. 1\u00a0 Lisa Cartwright, Screening the Body, Ch. 5\u00a0\u00a09) Design and Branding\u00a0Readings:  Hal Foster, Design and Crime, 27\u201362. \u00a0\u00a010) The Politics of Mass Display \u00a0Reading:  \u738b\u660e\u8ce2, \u56b4\u5584\u931e, \u300a\u65b0\u4e2d\u570b\u7f8e\u8853\u5716\u53f2\u300b, 24\u201353.\u00a0 \u795d\u52c7, \u300a\u53cd\u95b1\u8b80\u300b, 35\u201362.\u00a0\u00a011) Seeing against the Grain\u00a0Reading:  Roland Barthes, \u201cThe Third Meaning,\u201d in Image-Music-Text\u00a0 Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright, Practices of Looking, 45\u201371\u00a0\u00a0Tutorials:\u00a01) Introduction\u00a02) Close study of a visual artist\u00a03) Close study of a filmmaker\u00a04) Design and Commercial Arts\u00a05) The Visual Dimension of Advertising \u00a06) The Visual Dimension of Cityscape", "required_readings": "Part I: Histories of Seeing The Visual Pursuit of the RealReading: Nicholas Mirzoeff, An Introduction to Visual Culture, Ch.1.

We explore the importance of the factor of age in the study of popular culture, explaining why youths are vulnerable to the manipulation of popular culture, and why their lifestyles and values also dominate popular culture. We also examine how youth identity is constructed around the dynamics between mainstream identity and subcultural identity, and students are given the chance to analyse their own socio-cultural worlds in the various cultural environment, including home, school, concerts, shopping malls, youth magazines, and the cyber-space. This course provides students with an understanding of why youths, in particular, are prone to collective identity, and how they achieve their sense of self through fashion, music, sports, and entertainment.", "outcome": "1.

We believe that a careful reading of these transnational flows would help us reconsider what Hong Kong culture and Chinese culture mean in contemporary bodies and indentity.

The aim of this course is to provide the students with a knowledge of and insight into the key concepts, the historical development, and the socio-cultural implications of performance both in international scene and local context. Not only do we study the archives, the manifestations, the theory and the practice of various performers, composers, choreographers, actors, art and stage directors from different periods and traditions, but we also focus on the interpretation and communication, the audience reception and spectatorship of the social mass. It is a course draws on a wide variety of disciplines including social sciences, semiotics, speech-act theory, psychoanalysis, gender and queer studies, with which we can investigate the stylistic features, the quality of theatricality, the technical change, the hybridity and the boundary-crossing of performance in our era.", "outcome": "On successful completion of the course, you will be able to:\u00a01.Understand the diversity and similarities of different Asian cultures from a cultural studies perspective\u00a02.Understand the unique position of Asia in the current globalization discourse\u00a03.

Nowadays comic strip has become one of the major forms of visual narratives in our culture. Both comics and film are visual arts originally developed within the period of late 19th century and early 20th century. Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a \u201cSequential Art\u201d and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression. We will also try to delineate the special communication mode of comics and its relationship with different aspects of modern society and culture. Students will learn to appreciate comic art from different perspectives, and strengthen analytical skills for visual media.", "outcome": "1.

This will allow us not only to realize literature as the principal record of Taoist tradition in its confirmation and valorization of Taoist values, but also to grapple with the literary challenge to inherited orthodoxies and thus the undermining of conventional ideas and feelings, as well as to sample the texture of literature functioning as an alternative or substitute for Taoism.

The belief system, indigenous custom, human diasporas as well as community cohesiveness of the Chinese can be illustrated from both temples and festivals in China and Hong Kong.", "outcome": "\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u8a8d\u8b58\u5edf\u5b87\u3001\u7bc0\u8a95\u8207\u6c11\u9593\u6587\u5316\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u901a\u904e\u5edf\u5b87\u3001\u7bc0\u8a95\u5be6\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u4e86\u89e3\u9999\u4e2d\u570b\u53ca\u6e2f\u6b77\u53f2\u8207\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5edf\u5b87\u3001\u7bc0\u8a95\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u9999\u6e2f\u6587\u7269\u4fdd\u80b2\u8207\u6587\u5316\u907a\u7522\u4fdd\u5b58\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5f9e\u5edf\u5b87\u770b\u50b3\u7d71\u5efa\u7bc9\u8207\u85dd\u8853\u96d5\u98fe\u7684\u7279\u8272\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u4ecb\u7d39\uff1a\u6b77\u53f2\u3001\u5206\u985e\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u00a0 \u00a0 \u4e2d\u570b\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u784f\u7a76\u8ab2\u984c\uff081):\u795e\u9748\u4fe1\u4ef0\u3001\u796d\u7940\u3001\u795e\u8a95\u548c\u7bc0\u6176\u00a0 \u00a0 \u4e2d\u570b\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u784f\u7a76\u8ab2\u984c(2):\u5b97\u65cf\u3001\u570b\u5bb6\u548c\u5730\u65b9\u793e\u6703\u00a0 \u00a0 \u4e2d\u570b\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u7684\u784f\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6b77\u53f2\u6587\u737b\u3001\u7891\u523b\u3001\u5100\u5f0f\u3001\u7530\u91ce\u8003\u5bdf\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76--\u500b\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff081): \u5929\u540e\u5edf\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76--\u500b\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff082): \u6587\u6b66\u5edf\u3001\u5317\u5e1d\u5edf\u00a0 \u00a0 \u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76\u500b-- \u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6790\uff081):\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u8207\u795e\u8a95\u7bc0\u6176\u53ca\u6253\u91ae\u00a0 \u00a0 \u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76\u500b-- \u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6790\uff082):\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u8b8a\u9077\u00a0 \u00a0 \u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76\u500b-- \u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6790\uff083):\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u8207\u5b97\u65cf\u53ca\u6751\u843d\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u795e\u9748\u4fe1\u4ef0\u53ca\u50b3\u7d71\uff1a(1):\u5929\u540e\u5143\u541b\u3001\u95dc\u8056\u5e1d\u541b\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u795e\u9748\u4fe1\u4ef0\u53ca\u50b3\u7d71\uff1a(2):\u5317\u5e1d\uff08\u771f\u6b66\u3001\u7384\u5929\u4e0a\u5e1d\uff09\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u9127\u6d77\u8d85\u7b49\u300a\u9999\u6e2f\u5cf6\u5340\u4e4b\u83ef\u4eba\u5edf\u5b87\u300b\uff0c\u9999\u6e2f\u5927\u5b78\u4e9e\u6d32\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c1983\u3002\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u9673\u614e\u6176\u7de8\u300a\u8af8\u795e\u5609\u5e74\u83ef\uff1a\u9999\u6e2f\u5b97\u6559\u7814\u7a76\u300b\uff0cHong Kong: Oxford University Press, 2002.\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jean Law & Barbara E.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": " Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:  Explain the concern of other-than-human animal with cultural studies perspective;  Identify the key issues and critical assessment of human-animal relationship;  Understand the approach in studying culture, animal and environment;  Enrich the angle of analyzing human living and animal species.", "syllabus": " Area A\u00a0 Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure Week 1.

We will first focus on this problematic by tracing a particular set of questions through which knowledge about Islam and Muslim politics has been produced. By reading excerpts from scholarly works and influential media outlets, by watching documentaries, and through discussions during the class, we will develop a framework in which to recognize, understand and appreciate the gamut of political predicaments that Islamic tradition and its practitioners face under modern conditions. By the end of the first half of this course, students are expected to develop the ability to engage the following questions: What kind of assumptions about Islam and politics inform popular discussions on this topic? How has the rise of modern state power shaped and reshaped Muslims\u2019 understanding of their tradition? What forms of lives, histories and struggles can and cannot be captured by this problematic? We will then spend the last several weeks exploring case studies that are considered to be paradigmatic of Islamic politics today. We will look at such historical and contemporary controversies as the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, the rise of ISIS, and the Jamal Khashoggi affair. In each given case, we will trace various ways in which the questions we addressed in the first half of the course continue to inhabit the narratives about how a supposedly \u201cauthentic\u201d Islam figures in Muslims\u2019 search for political and cultural legitimacy in modern times. Thus, the course does not aim so much to provide a survey of Muslims politics, but to develop a critical perspective on the key concepts and images that frame Muslims\u2019 and non-Muslims\u2019 discussions about the convergence between Islam and modern politics.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3130", "title": "Religious Imagination and Visual Art", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "This course introduces students to the study of religion, art and visual culture.

Introduction: arts and the infrastructure of power and arts\u00a0 This session gives introduction to the course content, and a general study of the social production of arts and its relationship\u00a0 with the infrastructure of power, using examples from primitive to contemporary societies.\u00a0\u00a02. Power of arts as political and social expression \u00a0 This session studies artistic expression and its relationship between the Church, monarchy and the merchant class during \u00a0 the Medieval, Renaissance and the 17th Century in Netherlands and France in order to reveal the relationship between \u00a0 patronages and artistic creation as well as their impacts on the mediation of arts.\u00a0\u00a03. The Socialist and the Avant-garde\u00a0 The 19th Century marks a significant development in the use of arts as instrument to challenge the Establishment. Starting \u00a0 off with the studies Gustave Courbet, this session studies the influences of the Socialist Movement and its relationship with \u00a0 the development of the avant-garde movement in arts.\u00a0\u00a04. The Grand Utopia: propagandas of the Communist and the Fascist\u00a0 This session studies some of the grandest cultural campaigns organized by the Communists and Fascists for \u00a0 propagandas in the early 20th Century, focusing on the aesthetic, techniques and the philosophies behind these grand \u00a0 projects.\u00a0\u00a05. Arts for social actions in China\u00a0 This session studies the application of arts for social causes, starting off with the promotion of Kathe Kollwitz by Lu Shen, \u00a0 the woodcut movement, the comics during the 1930s and 40s, the aesthetic of the Chinese Revolution and moving onto the \u00a0 cultural actions by Chinese contemporary arts groups during the 1980s.\u00a0\u00a06. Social activist arts since 1960s: toward the community\u00a0 Since the civil right movement in the 1960s, cultural workers in the West become increasingly active in utilizing arts for \u00a0 social and political critiques. Frequently such critiques find their expression in community art. This session studies the \u00a0 concepts and approaches of community arts, which has experienced a dramatic growth since the 1960s.\u00a0\u00a07. Arts for social actions in Hong Kong\u00a0 Tracing back to the local political comic and woodcut during the 1930s and 40s, this session studies the use of arts for \u00a0 social actions, looking at the formats of expression and strategies employed by organizations and alternative activist \u00a0 groups in Hong Kong during the 20th Century.\u00a0\u00a08. Star Ferry Pier and its impacts\u00a0 The dismantling of Star Ferry Pier not only marks a new chapter in heritage conservation, but also triggers a new movement \u00a0 in which cultural workers are actively engaged in social activism. Arts are frequently used as instruments for propagandas\u00a0 and for the nurturing a sense of cultural identity at grass-root level. This session will focus on this phenomenon and its \u00a0 implications to the cultural development of Hong Kong. \u00a0\u00a09. Organizing cultural activist actions\u00a0 This session informs student of the basic organizational format, operational requirement and managerial needs for \u00a0 organizing cultural activist actions in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a010.Getting support\u00a0 This session studies the techniques and methods of acquiring resources for supporting community arts activities. It \u00a0 informs students channels and techniques to seek funding, and ways to building communal volunteer support.\u00a0\u00a011.Managerial practice: Case studies \u00a0 This session focuses on cultural activist groups which use arts for social empowerment to nurture self awareness and \u00a0 ability to engage in social and political critique. Groups identified for case studies include CCAC and Video Activist and \u00a0 HKADA. \u00a0\u00a012.Theories, conflict and ethical issues\u00a0 The employment of arts for social and political calls generates numerous debates over the concepts and ethics behind \u00a0 such practices. This session discusses the various views and debates within the field concerning the formats of practices,\u00a0 and investigates some of the ethical issues relating to it.\u00a0\u00a013.Review and discussion", "required_readings": "Introduction: arts and the infrastructure of power and artsJacques Ellul <Propaganda> Vintage Book, N.Y., 1973\u9673\u96f2 <\u5ba3\u50b3>2010\u5e746\u670811\u65e5\u4fe1\u5831History of Propaganda: Power of arts as political and social expressionPhilip M Taylor, \u2018Looking Through a Glass Onion: Propaganda, Physiological Warfare andPersuasion\u2019, <A History of Propaganda from the Ancient World to the Present Day\u2019 P.1-16,Manchester University Press, 2003Martha Rosler, \u2018Place, Position, Power, Politics\u2019, <The Subversive Imagination> edited byCarol Becker, P.55-76, Routledge, 1994The Grand Utopia: propagandas of the Communist and the FascistRobert Hughes, \u2018The Faces of Power\u2019, P.87-105, <The Shock of the New\u2019, Alfred A.

The course will be based in the computer lab with workshops held every week covering the fundamentals of 3D modeling; sculpting meshes, texturing, lighting, rigging and rendering animations as well as creative design principles of 3D animation. The course takes the definition of the 'postdigital' as a description of our contemporary relation to the internet and technology from the post-2000's when it is no longer perceived as 'new' but integrated into the fabric of our daily lives. It will examine how postdigital animation has been integrated into multiple interfaces (smartphones, laptops, pads), media (film, video, digital) and platforms (theatres, exhibitions) and focus specifically on the Asian context, looking at the works of various artists working with animation and how they have moved beyond translating traditional media into new media through 'remediation' (Manovich: 2014), to create entirely new aesthetic vocabularies in virtual spaces. Students will be expected to create a short 3D animated film as the final assessment which demonstrates a thorough understanding of 3D modeling techniques and the digital animation production process taught over the course of the semester. Additionally, the students will be expected to critically evaluate and understand how contemporary Asian artists are using 3D animation as a part of their practice to creatively express their responses to Asian society, culture and history. Students will critically engage with readings each week which will ultimately give them a through understanding of key issues relevant to contemporary animation in academia and in pop culture.
