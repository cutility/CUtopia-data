How are we attracted to their smartness or ridiculousness?How does the media industry construct the stars body and beauty? How does our celebrity culture enrich Hong Kong and the world?Celebrity is a critical feature of (post)modern society, especially in our entertaining-oriented Hong Kong culture. Hong Kong had been influenced by foreign popular icons for many decades, but the affluent city also has its own culture of celebrity. From Elvis Presley and Beatles to Michael Jackson, Madonna and Lady Gaga; Bruce Lee (\u674e\u5c0f\u9f8d) to Jackie Chan (\u6210\u9f8d) and Stephen Chow (\u5468\u661f\u99b3); and even Princess Diana to Joshua Wong (\u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2), \u201cwell known people\u201d of different areas, although not necessarily being stars of popular culture, have varied extent of social signification. This course discusses the phenomenon of modern celebrity and stardom in Hong Kong, traces the historical evolution of the concepts and differences of celebrity and stardom, and uncovers the influences of electronic media to the culture of celebrity.

How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5).

In particular, this course will emphasize the historical and cultural shaping of health disparities and examine how issues of power contribute to unequal patterns of risk and disease in our modern society. To do this, students will learn major theories and methods in the cultural study of health and medicine to understand how culture, power, and identity\u2014including race, gender, capitalism, and colonialism\u2014 shapes the management of disease and individual illness experience in both Asian and global contexts. A critical concern in this course is how the organization of medical care confronts questions of social justice in medical treatment and public health in historical and contemporary contexts. Students will also grapple with the question of whether our institutions of medicine and public health function as a form of social control. By introducing students to the social components of health and illness, it aims to foster cross-disciplinary conversations across the faculties of arts, medicine, and other divisions at CUHK.Following the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal of Reducing Inequality (SDG #10), a central question in this course is how medical treatments, research, and public health confront, or fail to confront, issues of social justice in global contexts. Students will learn theoretical approaches to health and inequality to investigate how history, culture, and politics shape the illness experience of socially marginalized people. These theories will enable students to assess the strengths and limits of our current arrangements of medical care and approaches to global health. In addition, students will learn critical medical humanities methods, such as ethnography, and use these methods to propose solutions to our current shortcomings in health governance. This course will challenge students to imagine better alternatives to our unequal world and demonstrate why the study of culture matters in medicine, global health, and public policy.", "outcome": "-Analyze how social inequality shapes disease outcomes (SDG #10)-Explain how media shapes public understandings of health and disease, including stigma-Situate individual illness experience in the social, political, and cultural contexts of disease-Implement the use of ethnography to develop health policies that can reduce inequality (SDG #10)", "syllabus": "Introduction: Critical Medical HumanitiesIn this introductory class, students will learn about the critical medical humanities as a method for interrogating fundamental questions of social justice in medicine: who gets sick, who gets better, and why? Students will be introduced to basic theories and concepts in the cultural studies of health and disease, such as stigma, biopolitics, and illness discourse, as tools for analyzing the complex social forces that shape health disparities. In addition, students will be provided with a basic introduction to public health systems, as well as information about the places and time periods that will be covered in the course.\u00a0Unit One: Race and DiseaseThis unit starts with the histories of international disease control in Asian contexts, with emphasis on how social, cultural, and racial differences shaped the management of disease in colonial spaces. Students will analyze how issues of power and identity inform public health interventions, which often protects the privileged while stigmatizing and harming others. We will use the Hong Kong plague outbreak of 1894 as a case study in health inequity and learn, for example, about the homes of migrant Chinese labourers being burned by colonial officials in the name of disease control. We will conclude the unit by reflecting on how ideas of race and other forms social difference still shape the framing of disease even in contemporary discourses. Students will utilize cultural theories on race, gender, class, and inequality to identify how social biases shapes disease perception and response to reduce health inequality.1.\u00a0 Difference and Disease in Tropical MedicineKey themes: hygienic modernity, power/knowledge, the \u201cnative\u201d body, the laboratory in colonial discourse, vaccine politics2.\u00a0\u00a0Colonial Tensions in Hong Kong\u2019s Plague PandemicKey themes: race and space, epidemic orientalism, the politics of quarantine and sanitary regimes, germ theory vs. local knowledge\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0Representing DiseaseKey themes: cultural representations of \u201cthe other\u201d in disease discourse, endemicity as a cultural concept, body politics, the role of media in shaping disease response, global healthUnit Two: The Politics of Identity in Medicine\u00a0Why are doctors often men? Why do doctors often come from socially dominant groups in terms of ethnicity and class privilege? What are the implications for how medicine is practiced? This unit offers answers to some of these questions by exploring the power structures that shape our institutions of medicine. We start with examining the social power of physicians. Students will learn about the social factors that shape how medical conditions come to be recognized, and the populations that are excluded or harmed in the pursuit of medical advancement. By understanding the politics of identity in medicine, students will gain the conceptual tools for understanding the health disparities that result when medicine often reflects the interests of socially dominant groups. Course discussions will invite students to apply concepts learned in this unit to address health disparities here in Hong Kong, where ethnic minorities representing 8.4% of the population face barriers in accessing care,\u00a0mental health resources are not yet able to address demand, and a fragile public health system offers diminished care for the city\u2019s neediest.4.

This unit will emphasize the illness experiences of marginalized social groups to examine the effects of social, political, and economic disenfranchisement on their bodies and health. By examining health and illness at the level of everyday life, students will develop an understanding of how ethnographic methods can be used to make interventions in health policy. In the concluding week, we will wrap up with a discussion about who benefits, and who may be harmed, in our current global health system and propose ways to align global health priorities with the principles health justice.8.

CURE2022.)  A long-lasting struggle of gender equity was triggered by the women\u2019s movements in England and U.S in the end of 19th century. Feminists fight for equality by publications, demonstrations and organizations. In 20th century, the feminist movement matured. Feminists have been more sensitive to the differences among women of different race, class, culture, religion and circumstances and noticed the importance of differences in unity. This course will introduce the strategies and main arguments of various kinds of feminism. Through learning from others\u2019 experience, history and our daily life, we will understand the development of diversity in feminisms. We can have more understanding of feminists fighting for the right of disadvantage groups by self-review and mutual criticism in different times and culture.", "outcome": "\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u89e3\u91cb\u5973\u6b0a\u904b\u52d5\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u8108\u80f32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u6bd4\u8f03\u5973\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9\u5404\u7a2e\u6d41\u6d3e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8207\u6642\u4ee3\u8b8a\u9077\u4e4b\u95dc\u4fc23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5206\u6790\u8fd1\u4ee3\u8207\u73fe\u4eca\u6027\u5225\u6b0a\u76ca\u4e8b\u4ef6", "syllabus": "    (The fundamental concepts and academic content which need to be understood in each course.

It will examine, in particular: the socio-political background of the emergence of the Taiwan New Cinema movement, its key directors and their works, the international context of their reception and the transnational nature of their production, and its legacy to date. It will provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the work of selected film authors and an awareness of the cinematic, cultural, and socio-political contexts in which they work, and enable students to analyse the work in relation to questions of transnationality and historiography.", "outcome": "On successful completion of this module, you should be able to:\u00a0\u00a0Module-specific skills:\u00a0\u00a0a.Demonstrate an advanced appreciation of the historical development of the Taiwan New Cinema movement, and its key directors and films.\u00a0b.Demonstrate an informed appreciation of how concepts of film authorship can be related to modes of production, modes of funding, and an international context of cinephilia. \u00a0c.Demonstrate an advanced critical understanding of key debates on the various aspects of transnational cinemas, from production and distribution to the analysis of texts and authors. \u00a0d.Demonstrate an advanced critical capacity to interrogate the notion of \u201cnational cinema\u201d and the way in which it has been challenged in film historiography. \u00a0\u00a0Discipline-specific skills:\u00a0\u00a0a.Demonstrate an advanced capacity to analyse films from different periods in the Taiwan New Cinema movement and to relate their concerns and modes of expression to their historical contexts. \u00a0b.Demonstrate advanced analytical skills in the close formal, thematic, generic and authorial analysis of different kinds of films. \u00a0c.Demonstrate advanced intellectual and critical skills in the research and evaluation of relevant material for the study of film and communicate these conclusions effectively and fluently using appropriate critical and technical language. \u00a0d.Demonstrate an advanced capacity to consider the relationship between film and its complex production conditions and to relate film history to a wider context beyond the national.\u00a0\u00a0Personal and key skills:\u00a0\u00a0a.Undertake independent research on the basis of a taught course. \u00a0b.Adopt a critical approach to the selection and organisation of a large body of material in order to produce, to a deadline, a written, oral or visually sustained argument of some complexity.\u00a0c.Present a cogent and sustained argument orally / in writing, in English, on an aspect of the subject of the student\u2019s own choosing, and selecting appropriate methods of exposition.\u00a0d.Using bibliographical material provided, select, plan and carry out a programme of study leading to an essay / presentation on a chosen topic, to a specified length and deadline.\u00a0e.Demonstrate ability to combine a variety of IT skills in researching and reporting on a topic.", "syllabus": "SYLLABUS PLAN\u00a0\u00a0Week 1 Taiwan Cinema Before \u201cTaiwan New Cinema\u201d\u00a0Week 2 The \u201cTaiwan New Cinema\u201d Movement\u00a0Week 3  Authorship (I): Hou Hsiao-hsien \u00a0Week 4  Authorship (II): Edward Yang\u00a0Week 5 No classes \u2013 Lunar New Year holidays\u00a0Week 6 Authorship (III): Ang Lee \u00a0Week 7  Authorship (IV): Tsai Ming-liang\u00a0Week 8 Transnationality (I): France\u00a0Week 9 Transnationality (II): USA\u00a0Week 10 Transnationality (III): Southeast Asia\u00a0Week 11  Historiography (I): Sinophone Cinema \u00a0Week 12  Historiography (II): Post-Taiwan New Cinema\u00a0Week 13 Essay writing workshop and consultation\u00a0Week 14 Essay writing workshop and consultation", "required_readings": "WEEK 1 \u00a0TAIWAN CINEMA BEFORE \u201cTAIWAN NEW CINEMA\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Required viewing:\u00a0A Touch of Zen (King Hu, 1971) \u4fe0\u5973\uff08\u80e1\u91d1\u9293\uff09\u00a0\u00a0Required reading:\u00a0*Taiwan Film Directors, \u201cIntroduction: Treasure Island\u201d, and Chapter 1, \u201cParallel \u00a0Cinemas: Postwar History and Major Directors\u201d.\u00a0Hong, Guo-Juin (2010) \u201cHistoriography of Absence: Taiwan Cinema Before New Cinema \u00a0 1982\u201d, Journal of Chinese Cinemas 4 (1): 5-14. \u00a0\u00a0Further reading:\u00a0Berry, Chris (2009) \u201cRe-writing Cinema: Markets, Languages, Cultures in Taiwan\u201d, in \u00a0Fang-long Shih, Stuart Thompson and Paul-Fran\u00e7ois Tremlett (eds.), Re-writing Culture in Taiwan, Abington, Oxon: Routledge, pp. 140-153.\u00a0Bordwell, David (2000) \u201cRichness through Imperfection: King Hu and the Glimpse\u201d, in \u00a0 Poshek Fu and David Desser (eds.), The Cinema of Hong Kong: History, Arts, \u00a0 Identity, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 113-136.\u00a0Farquhar, Mary (2003) \u201cA Touch of Zen: Action in Martial Arts Movies\u201d, in Chris Berry \u00a0 (ed.), Chinese Films in Focus: 25 New Takes, London: BFI Publishing, 167-174. \u00a0Horng, Menghsin C.

Students are expected to look into these everyday occurrences with sociological, anthropological, literary, and philosophical analytical tools.

The mediation as such is not so much in the traditional, materialistic sense of use and pleasurable experience, as melting of all that is solid into signs and their consumption.

They are also expected to understand the intimate relationship between film production and film consumption, as well as the differences and connections between art and commerce in the domain of Hong Kong cinema.", "syllabus": " The lectures are organized historically, allowing students to gain a full picture of not only Hong Kong cinema\u2019s history but also the history of Hong Kong.

We will study carefully and critically various forms of representations to the issues of paintings, illustrations, photography, films, television, and video games. We will learn the languages developed for these visual forms, and how ideologies are structured and conveyed through these visual depictions. In this visual age, while we are bombarded with more and more visual information and sensations, we are also effectively deskilled in our capacities as interpretive beings in critically engaging with these visual representations. This course teaches students how to appreciate the rich hermeneutic possibilities inherent in the visual culture and at the same time to be critical of ways that the viewers are rendered vulnerable to be manipulated by the visual images.", "outcome": "Students in this course are expected to learn how our social order and communities are made up of visual languages and expressions. They are also expected to know the ideological and economic links among production, circulation, and consumption in the realm of visual culture. Through an interdisciplinary approach, students would develop a visual literacy, learning that meanings and emotions can be conveyed visually. Students will also develop critical awareness related to issues pertaining to gender, racial, class, and national identities through the studies of visual representations.", "syllabus": "Part I: Visualizing the Real\u00a0\u00a01) The Visual Pursuit of the Real\u00a0Reading:  Nicholas Mirzoeff, An Introduction to Visual Culture, Ch.1\u00a0\u00a02) Realism and Anti-Realism\u00a0Reading: Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright, Practices of Looking, 109-130;\u00a0 Jacques Meuris, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, pp.72\u2013101\u00a0\u00a03) From Lithography to Photography\u00a0Reading:  Susan Sontag, On Photography\u00a0\u00a04) Moving Images\u00a0Reading:  Andr\u00e9 Bazin, What is Cinema? 1, pp. 23\u201340 \u00a0\u00a05) Digital Imaging\u00a0Reading:  Lev Manovich, The Language of New Media, pp. 49\u201361, 293\u2013308\u00a0 Jay David Bolter & Richard Grusin, Remediation, pp. 2\u201315.\u00a0\u00a0Part II: The Politics of Seeing\u00a0\u00a06) Seeing and Subjection\u00a0Reading:  John Berger, Ways of Seeing\u00a0\u00a07) The Ethics of Seeing\u00a0Reading:  Stuart Hall, \u201cThe Spectacle of the 'Other'\u201d in Representation\u00a0\u00a08) Seeing and Modernity\u00a0Readings:  Jonathan Crary, Techniques of the Observers, Ch. 1\u00a0 Lisa Cartwright, Screening the Body, Ch. 5\u00a0\u00a09) Design and Branding\u00a0Readings:  Hal Foster, Design and Crime, 27\u201362. \u00a0\u00a010) The Politics of Mass Display \u00a0Reading:  \u738b\u660e\u8ce2, \u56b4\u5584\u931e, \u300a\u65b0\u4e2d\u570b\u7f8e\u8853\u5716\u53f2\u300b, 24\u201353.\u00a0 \u795d\u52c7, \u300a\u53cd\u95b1\u8b80\u300b, 35\u201362.\u00a0\u00a011) Seeing against the Grain\u00a0Reading:  Roland Barthes, \u201cThe Third Meaning,\u201d in Image-Music-Text\u00a0 Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright, Practices of Looking, 45\u201371\u00a0\u00a0Tutorials:\u00a01) Introduction\u00a02) Close study of a visual artist\u00a03) Close study of a filmmaker\u00a04) Design and Commercial Arts\u00a05) The Visual Dimension of Advertising \u00a06) The Visual Dimension of Cityscape", "required_readings": "Part I: Histories of Seeing The Visual Pursuit of the RealReading: Nicholas Mirzoeff, An Introduction to Visual Culture, Ch.1.

The aim of this course is to provide the students with a knowledge of and insight into the key concepts, the historical development, and the socio-cultural implications of performance both in international scene and local context. Not only do we study the archives, the manifestations, the theory and the practice of various performers, composers, choreographers, actors, art and stage directors from different periods and traditions, but we also focus on the interpretation and communication, the audience reception and spectatorship of the social mass. It is a course draws on a wide variety of disciplines including social sciences, semiotics, speech-act theory, psychoanalysis, gender and queer studies, with which we can investigate the stylistic features, the quality of theatricality, the technical change, the hybridity and the boundary-crossing of performance in our era.", "outcome": "On successful completion of the course, you will be able to:\u00a01.Understand the diversity and similarities of different Asian cultures from a cultural studies perspective\u00a02.Understand the unique position of Asia in the current globalization discourse\u00a03.

Nowadays comic strip has become one of the major forms of visual narratives in our culture. Both comics and film are visual arts originally developed within the period of late 19th century and early 20th century. Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a \u201cSequential Art\u201d and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression. We will also try to delineate the special communication mode of comics and its relationship with different aspects of modern society and culture. Students will learn to appreciate comic art from different perspectives, and strengthen analytical skills for visual media.", "outcome": "1. Through the lectures, students will recognize the aesthetic nature of sequential art and locate the humanistic values and meanings of comic arts for modern society and culture.2. Through tutorial discussions, student will apply the analytical skills and formal methods to interpret comic and visual texts.\u00a03. Through mid-term assignment (research portfolio on the visual representation of comics), student will distinguish, compare, analyze and criticize different visual and multimedia sources.\u00a04. Through final paper, student will prepare and manage to do an academic research on visual representation.\u00a05. Student will aware, judge and appraise the practical values of the analytical skills and historical knowledge provided by this course after they complete the mid-term assignment and final paper.", "syllabus": "\u00a0Section 1: The Rise of Comic Art\u00a01.

While there are many approaches to the understanding of the discipline of religion and literature, this course covers traditional Chinese literature in relation to Taoist thought, practice, institution, and symbolism. The focus is on the formation of literary genres as religious expression and transcendental imagination in the context, as much as possible, of the development of Taoist religion. This will allow us not only to realize literature as the principal record of Taoist tradition in its confirmation and valorization of Taoist values, but also to grapple with the literary challenge to inherited orthodoxies and thus the undermining of conventional ideas and feelings, as well as to sample the texture of literature functioning as an alternative or substitute for Taoism. In this way, we can approach the intersections of the aesthetic and the religious as the essential humanity through the reading and analysis of the Taoist dimensions of literature.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2142", "title": "Religion and Ethics", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "An examination of the relationship of the Christian and various other world views to ethical issues of contemporary society.", "outcome": "Having fully engaged with the course, students are expected to have:\u00a0~ a basic familiarity with different approaches of ethics;\u00a0~ a basic knowledge of the relationships between religions and ethics;\u00a0~ an awareness of the importance of religious insights in dealing with ethical issues;\u00a0~ an ability to engage in interdisciplinary dialogues between religion and ethics.", "syllabus": "Part One: Approaches of Ethics\u00a0Lecture 1 : Virtue Ethics, Becoming a \u201cVirtuous Being\u201d\u00a0Lecture 2 : Natural Law Ethics, Conforming to the law of the \u201cNatural\u201d\u00a0Lecture 3 : Teleology, Utilitarianism, Achieving \u201cWhat is Good\u201d\u00a0Lecture 4 : Deontology, Kantian Ethics, The Divine Command Theory, Doing \u201cWhat is Right\u201d\u00a0Lecture 5 : Ethics of Responsibility, Responsive to Others\u2019 Needs, Doing \u201cWhat is Fitting\u201d\u00a0Lecture 6 : Whether Ethics is dependent on Religion?\u00a0\u00a0Part Two: Relationships between Religion and Ethics\u00a0Lecture 7 : Ethical Disaster Reshaping Religious Thought\u00a0Lecture 8 : Religious Resources for Ethics: Scripture, Tradition, Reason, Experience\u00a0\u00a0Part Three: Facing Ethical Issues in Religious Perspectives\u00a0Lecture 9 : Technology\u00a0Lecture 10 : Just War\u00a0Lecture 11 : Economics\u00a0Lecture 12 : Ecology", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": "Aristotle, \u201cSelections from the Nicomachean Ethics\u201d, Chapter 3 in Theodore Denise and et al eds., Great Traditions in Ethics (Belmont, CA: Thomson/ Wadsworth, 2005), pp.22-36.\u00a0William Frankena, Ethics (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1973), 2nd edition, pp.. 61-78.\u00a0Kenneth E.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3006", "title": "Special Topics in Cultural Studies", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "The specific topics of this course vary from year to year.

Initially a Cold War construct comprising Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, and Timor-Leste, the term \u2018Southeast Asia\u2019 has come to refer to a highly complex and pluralistic region of over 660 million people, 25,000 islands, and 150 ethnolinguistic communities. With its national identities formed from the encounter with and struggle against American, British, French, Dutch, Hispanic, Indian, Japanese, and Chinese influence, Southeast Asia\u2019s movies have served as venues for propaganda and resistance. This course looks at how the remediations of different genres such as noir, melodrama, western, and sci-fi tackle controversial issues of gender, race, religion, poverty, migration, and the environment. Instead of smoothening the continuity of official historical narratives, it uncovers how documentaries, epics, and horror reexamine the trauma of past colonization, authoritarianism, and violence. To conclude, the course explores how television serials, anthology films, and online databases trace nascent cross-border and intra-regional communities beyond the limits of sovereignty.", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to: \u00a0  To become acquainted with the key filmmakers, works, themes, and issues in Southeast Asian cinema  To explain how film and media representations visualize and problematize the distinct social, economic, political, and historical conditions of diverse Southeast Asian cultures  To apply a comparative, transnational lens to examine film and media representations that illustrate how these diverse Southeast Asian cultures have become articulated in Hong Kong", "syllabus": " Week 1: Visualizing Southeast Asia   How do scholars, filmmakers, and artists imagine Southeast Asia?

We will first focus on this problematic by tracing a particular set of questions through which knowledge about Islam and Muslim politics has been produced. By reading excerpts from scholarly works and influential media outlets, by watching documentaries, and through discussions during the class, we will develop a framework in which to recognize, understand and appreciate the gamut of political predicaments that Islamic tradition and its practitioners face under modern conditions. By the end of the first half of this course, students are expected to develop the ability to engage the following questions: What kind of assumptions about Islam and politics inform popular discussions on this topic? How has the rise of modern state power shaped and reshaped Muslims\u2019 understanding of their tradition? What forms of lives, histories and struggles can and cannot be captured by this problematic? We will then spend the last several weeks exploring case studies that are considered to be paradigmatic of Islamic politics today. We will look at such historical and contemporary controversies as the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, the rise of ISIS, and the Jamal Khashoggi affair. In each given case, we will trace various ways in which the questions we addressed in the first half of the course continue to inhabit the narratives about how a supposedly \u201cauthentic\u201d Islam figures in Muslims\u2019 search for political and cultural legitimacy in modern times. Thus, the course does not aim so much to provide a survey of Muslims politics, but to develop a critical perspective on the key concepts and images that frame Muslims\u2019 and non-Muslims\u2019 discussions about the convergence between Islam and modern politics.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3130", "title": "Religious Imagination and Visual Art", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "This course introduces students to the study of religion, art and visual culture.

A large number of works of May Fourth writers (such as Lu Xun, Bing Xin and Xu Dishan) are filled with biblical images, themes, allusions and quotations. Meanwhile, many Chinese translations of the Bible are heavily influenced by the Chinese cultural and literary traditions. For instance, Yan Fu\u2019s translation of the Gospel of Mark employs an elegant style of classical Chinese, while Wu Jingxiong\u2019s Psalms adopts the refined forms of Shijing (The Book of Songs) and Chuci (The Songs of Chu). This course aims to examine the intricate interactions between Chinese literature and the Bible, particularly the influences of Chinese literary traditions on the translations of the Bible and the rhetorical influences of the Bible on the emergence of modern Chinese literature, with a view to widening students\u2019 perspectives in the interdisciplinary study of literature and religion.", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:\u00a01.

Introduction: arts and the infrastructure of power and arts\u00a0 This session gives introduction to the course content, and a general study of the social production of arts and its relationship\u00a0 with the infrastructure of power, using examples from primitive to contemporary societies.\u00a0\u00a02. Power of arts as political and social expression \u00a0 This session studies artistic expression and its relationship between the Church, monarchy and the merchant class during \u00a0 the Medieval, Renaissance and the 17th Century in Netherlands and France in order to reveal the relationship between \u00a0 patronages and artistic creation as well as their impacts on the mediation of arts.\u00a0\u00a03. The Socialist and the Avant-garde\u00a0 The 19th Century marks a significant development in the use of arts as instrument to challenge the Establishment. Starting \u00a0 off with the studies Gustave Courbet, this session studies the influences of the Socialist Movement and its relationship with \u00a0 the development of the avant-garde movement in arts.\u00a0\u00a04. The Grand Utopia: propagandas of the Communist and the Fascist\u00a0 This session studies some of the grandest cultural campaigns organized by the Communists and Fascists for \u00a0 propagandas in the early 20th Century, focusing on the aesthetic, techniques and the philosophies behind these grand \u00a0 projects.\u00a0\u00a05. Arts for social actions in China\u00a0 This session studies the application of arts for social causes, starting off with the promotion of Kathe Kollwitz by Lu Shen, \u00a0 the woodcut movement, the comics during the 1930s and 40s, the aesthetic of the Chinese Revolution and moving onto the \u00a0 cultural actions by Chinese contemporary arts groups during the 1980s.\u00a0\u00a06. Social activist arts since 1960s: toward the community\u00a0 Since the civil right movement in the 1960s, cultural workers in the West become increasingly active in utilizing arts for \u00a0 social and political critiques. Frequently such critiques find their expression in community art.

Arts for social actions in Hong Kong\u00a0 Tracing back to the local political comic and woodcut during the 1930s and 40s, this session studies the use of arts for \u00a0 social actions, looking at the formats of expression and strategies employed by organizations and alternative activist \u00a0 groups in Hong Kong during the 20th Century.\u00a0\u00a08. Star Ferry Pier and its impacts\u00a0 The dismantling of Star Ferry Pier not only marks a new chapter in heritage conservation, but also triggers a new movement \u00a0 in which cultural workers are actively engaged in social activism.

It will balance a historical and theoretical overview of the concepts and principles of 3D digital animation alongside teaching students the skills for working with the free, open-source 3D creation software Blender to produce animations and 3D models. The course will be based in the computer lab with workshops held every week covering the fundamentals of 3D modeling; sculpting meshes, texturing, lighting, rigging and rendering animations as well as creative design principles of 3D animation. The course takes the definition of the 'postdigital' as a description of our contemporary relation to the internet and technology from the post-2000's when it is no longer perceived as 'new' but integrated into the fabric of our daily lives. It will examine how postdigital animation has been integrated into multiple interfaces (smartphones, laptops, pads), media (film, video, digital) and platforms (theatres, exhibitions) and focus specifically on the Asian context, looking at the works of various artists working with animation and how they have moved beyond translating traditional media into new media through 'remediation' (Manovich: 2014), to create entirely new aesthetic vocabularies in virtual spaces. Students will be expected to create a short 3D animated film as the final assessment which demonstrates a thorough understanding of 3D modeling techniques and the digital animation production process taught over the course of the semester. Additionally, the students will be expected to critically evaluate and understand how contemporary Asian artists are using 3D animation as a part of their practice to creatively express their responses to Asian society, culture and history. Students will critically engage with readings each week which will ultimately give them a through understanding of key issues relevant to contemporary animation in academia and in pop culture. The ultimate outcome for the course is that students are able to use the tools and skills involved in 3D animation to become artists themselves or integrate it into their professional roles as filmmakers, designers, curators or art administration professionals.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4121", "title": "Chan School of Buddhism", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "The Chan movement has been described by Hu Shih as a reformation or revolution in Buddhism and by Suzuki as a movement in which the Chinese mind completely asserted itself, in a sense, in opposition to the Indian mind.
