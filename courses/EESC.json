The course provides an interdisciplinary study of the Earth Systems, including natural phenomena in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. The mechanism of these systems, associated dynamics and anthropogenic impacts will be introduced and discussed. The course also serves as a platform to understand and critically assess global environmental change, natural hazards, biodiversity loss, and the water-energy-food nexus, and explore potential technological and policy solutions to these problems. These objectives align strongly with the understanding and pursuit of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#13 Climate Action, SDG#14 Life Below Water, and SDG#15 Life on Land. In addition to attending lectures, students will visit the Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change where it displays the way scientists examine past and current climate and the factors leading to current global temperature change. A geological field excursion will be another highlight of the course to demonstrate the scientific concepts applied to reveal Earth\u2019s tectonic history, evolution and interaction among various spheres. With diverse scientific topics in Earth\u2019s systems, the course shows students how each Earth\u2019s system is interlocking with other spheres and, hence raise the awareness in the importance of sustainability.", "outcome": "  Describe and explain how the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere interact and how feedback mechanisms operate among the Earth systems.
