ESSC3110 is an intermediate level course of the Earth System Science Programme. It covers important aspects of field geology, including sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic petrology, tectonics, geophysics and surficial processes. The principal goal of this course is to train students to recognize different lithological units and their geometries in three dimensions, and understand the related tectonic environment and formation mechanism. Class lectures introduce basic skills of reading and interpreting geological maps, using geological equipment (i.e. Compass-clinometer, GPS receiver), and producing field notes and reports. Field projects include field observation and description, techniques of field data acquisition and analysis, sample collection, and geological map compilation. Field projects also focus on surficial processes (relatively occurring on short geological time scale), which are of environmental and ecological importance.

This course actively incorporates elements of innovation, design, global citizenship and social enterprisingness by asking the students to think innovatively but critically about possible solutions to adapt to and combat climate change and the global energy/health crisis. Different options including their pros and cons are actively discussed in class. Students are encouraged to think creatively about the problem from different angles, e.g., by standing in the shoes of climate skeptics \u2013 evaluating their \u201cdata\u201d, how they present them, the arguments put forth by them \u2013 in order to develop a strategic approach to best communicate the issues to a variety of stakeholders. Project assignments will allow students to focus on one particular environmental issue in other part of the world, attempting to address the issue in the very different geographical, cultural, economic and political contexts from that of the students. Example projects can be \u201cHow to use geoengineering to combat climate change?\u201d, \u201cHow can Sub-Saharan Africa secure its future food supply under the threat of climate change?\u201d, etc. In the course, students will define and understand the problem. They shall form groups and discuss their own point of views and search information on the evidence of the corresponding arguments. They will present their ideas in class and write a self-reflection report. Each of the group will have to make an \u201cinfographic\u201d- a layout of science knowledge learnt in the project that is easy enough for the public to understand but at the same time informative. Good infographics will be used in our OpenDay.", "outcome": "At the completion of this course, the students will be able to1) gain understanding of basic climate science behind the global warming issue, including how Earth\u2019s global temperature has been measured by scientists and how the global average temperature is calculated2) study observations from different components of Earth besides the atmosphere, such as ocean and cryosphere observations, and how these components are affected by the human activities3) study how the scientific problem is presented and perceived in the society and learn how to use one\u2019s scientific knowledge to identify possible solutionsThe active incorporation of elements of innovation and design in the course is critical in allowing the students to develop a keen scientific mindset and logic flow to understand the complexity of the climate change and energy issues (Learning Outcome #1), and to dissect the reasons behind contradictory arguments in a society (Learning Outcome #3). Critical evaluation of the arguments from both sides (climate alarmists vs. skeptics) will ultimately allow them to develop their own stance in the issue, and think critically about the ways to move the world forward towards sustainability (Learning Outcome #3). The incorporation of global citizenship and social enterprisingness is also crucial for students to develop a keen awareness of how environmental issues affect people in a huge variety of geographical and cultural contexts (Learning Outcome #2), and think critically about what kinds of solutions best fit a certain region (Learning Outcome #3).", "syllabus": "\u2022\u00a0 L01 Changing Planet (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L02 Energy: A Closer Look (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L03 Energy and Heat (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L04 Fossil Energy (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L05 Impacts of Fossil Fuels (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L06 Nuclear Energy (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 Documentary Quiz: Pandora Promise (1.5 hour of video quiz)\u2022\u00a0 L07 Energy from Earth and Moon (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L08 Direct from the Sun: Solar Energy (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 Documentary: Minimalism (1.5 hour of video)\u2022\u00a0 L09 Basic Climate Science (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L10 Climate Forcing (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 Documentary Quiz: Merchants of Doubt (1.5 hour of video quiz)\u2022\u00a0 L11 Tropical Cyclone and Climate Change (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L12 Ocean Observations (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 Documentary: Mission Blue (1.5 hour of video)\u2022\u00a0 L13 Cryosphere (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 Documentary: Chasing Ice (1.5 hour of video)\u2022\u00a0 L14 Future Climate (2 lecture-hours)\u2022\u00a0 L15 Energy and Climate: Breaking the Link (2 lecture-hours)", "required_readings": "Refer to the course syllabus distributed in the class.", "recommended_readings": "1.
