In the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should \u201c\u5916\u5e2b\u9020\u5316\uff0c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5fc3\u6e90\u201d (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the \u201cheart-source\u201d of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field\u2019s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like \u201c\u6c23\u97fb\u751f\u52d5\u201d (infusing ch\u2019i to show life movement) or \u201c\u610f\u8da3\u201d (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their \u201cheart-source\u201d. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting \u201ctranslates\u201d the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists\u2019 cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the \u201cheart-source\u201d of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits.

The presumption that artist cannot contribute significantly to public sector is questionable nowadays\u2014there are many experiments being done to show that artistic intervention can somehow arouse the awareness of hidden power and political structure of the society. As a citizen or an artist, art has a role to play in public space.Seeing public space as an arena for artistic expression becomes another focus in contemporary art. Gallery, museum which are supposed to be neutral space in showing art is gradually replaced by space with cultural significances; message in art has been put into specific context for holistic examination. The course will cover various art forms in public space, which include traditionally defined public art, such as sculpture and functional objects in public space.
