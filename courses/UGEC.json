It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and 3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix.

Having taken this course, students will be equipped with a basic ability to analyse cultural phenomenon in the lens of such cultural concepts as indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows, media mix, cultural colonialism and orientalism.", "syllabus": "Main Objective:This main purpose of course is to examine the global popularization and localization of Japanese popular culture from historical, cultural and comparative perspectives within the theoretical framework of cultural globalization. It aims to indicate that the cultural flows between Japan and Asia are by no means one-way traffic and Asia has been interacting and collaborating with the Japanese in creating, manufacturing, marketing and distributing cultural products for decades. Lectures, discussions and readings highlight different facets of cultural acculturation and transnational interaction found in Japan-Asia cross-cultural flows, such as appropriation, hybridization, global localization business strategy, the making of localized editions, the local application of Japanese formula, joint production, and the participation of foreign artists and staff. Solidly grounding on empirical data as well as theories from cultural globalization and cross-cultural studies, this course will be a pioneering teaching and learning project to explore uncharted research territories in Japanese studies, Japan-Hong Kong relations, and cultural studies.\u00a0Key Issues and Problems:The following key issues and problems regarding the globalization of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context will be addressed in this course within the theoretical fiarnework of cultural globalization:\u00a01) The idea that the influx of Japanese cultural products is a form of cultural imperialism that aims to expand Japanese economic interest and to spread Japanese value and lifestyle in Asia will be empirically and theoretically reexamined and challenged. It shows that cultural imperialism is an outdated model in cross-cultural studies, because it fails to understand the dynamic mechanism in transnational cultural flows and cultural forces of localization and hybridization.2) While using \"glocalization\" (Roland Robertson uses it to refer to the localization strategy employed by multi-national companies to promote their products in different nations) to investigate the global business strategy of Japanese companies such as Sony, Nintendo, Capcom and Bandai in Asian and global markets, this course underscores the limitation of the glocalization theory in the East Asian context, as it fails to see the initiative taken by Asian artists and businessmen to creatively and selectively domesticate Japanese elements.3) This course uses Japanese popular culture as a mirror or text to decode social and cultural issues of contemporary Japan. For examples, themes about ethnicity, gender, social hierarchy, political ideology, and cultural identity will be examined in the lens of Japanese popular culture.\u00a0Core Content, Structure and Selected Topics:The course content of this course investigates the three facets of Japanese popular culture: (1) the application of cultural globalization theory in Japan, (2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries, (3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Accordingly, its structure follows the design of core content and contains the following three parts:\u00a0Part 1: Japanese Popular Culture and Cultural Globalization: Theories and PracticesSelected Topics:(a) Introduction to Basic Theories in Cultural Studies and Cultural Globalization(b) Globalization of Japanese Popular Culture in an Asian Context(c) Reexamining the Cultural Imperialism, Orientalism and Nihonjinron\u00a0 Discourses(d) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (1) Food and Fashion(e) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (2) TV Programs\u00a0Part 2: Interplay between Globalization and JapanesenessSelected Topics:(a) Nihonjinron in Japanese Movies and Alternative Mode of Globalization(b) The Formation of Japanese Manga and Anime and Their Hybridity(c) The Making of an Otaku Culture in Japan and Beyond(d) The Adaptation of Chinese Tradition in Japanese popular culture\u00a0Part 3: The Global Strategy of Japanese Cultural IndustriesSelected Topics:(a) Glocalization of Japanese Video Games and Cyber Culture(b) Transnational Collaboration and Cross-cultural Themes in Japanese Movies(c) Japaneseness and Universality in Japanese Comics and Animated Series(d) Exporting and Domesticating Japanese Formula in Asian Drama and Music(e) Media-mix as a Business Strategy in Japanese Cultural Industries\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Koichi Iwabuchi, Recentering Globalization: Popular Culture and Japanese Transnationalism (Duke UP, 2002), chapters 1-3, 5.2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D.

These theories were selected because of their direct relevance for developing an understanding of modern government behaviour. \u00a0 Public administration is often considered in a managerial manner, as little more than control and straightforward analysis of efficiency and economy. This is not necessarily the case. People from different walks of life tend to have different expectations of government. This course is intended to foster a change in attitudes among students. After the course, students are expected to have the ability and tendency to think critically from multidisciplinary perspectives and to provide a critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of any theoretical approach. Most important of all, by taking this course, students should have developed an understanding of the basic concepts and theories in public administration and should have gained the ability to apply them to the context of Hong Kong. Public administration, as an area of study, is very much a study based in American context. Therefore, it is important for students to reflect on the concepts and approaches covered in the course, and to consider how they can contribute to a better understanding of public administration in Hong Kong. The course is intended to reinforce communication skills on the part of students. Through the training in debates and discussions, students should have developed the ability to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organized manner.", "syllabus": "Teaching Plan and Readings (* required readings)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part I.

It will cover history and political ideologies in North Korea, North Korean economic reform and the development of underground economy, policy of nuclear brinkmanship, controversial issues of human rights violations, North Korean defectors and the inter-Korean relations, art and propaganda in North Korea, North Korea travel and tourism development, and also sports and nationalism in North Korea.", "outcome": " Course Objectives: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Student will learn theory of military dictatorship regime, mad-man theory and theory of nuclear proliferation.

Chapter 1&2 Introduction to Drugs The first two chapters discuss the physiological and psychological effects of mind-altering substances and their use from \u201ctraditional\u201d societies to modern societies. Module 2: Drug Effects Chapter 3&4 Addictive Drugs: Alcohol and Heroin These two chapters introduce two highly addictive drugs, namely alcohol and heroin. We discuss their cultural consumption and harmful effects and how institutional mechanisms in different societies regulate these drugs. Chapter 5&6 Psychoactive Drugs: Marijuana and LSD These two chapters discuss the controversy over drug legalization, particularly marijuana and LSD. We discuss the effects of these drugs and whether their medical and/or recreational use should be legalized. Module 3: Drug Prevention and Treatment Chapter 7&8 Drug Scene in Hong Kong and China These two chapters discuss the changing drug use patterns in Hong Kong and China and examine how these changes are interweaved with an array of social factors, such as migration and economic development. Chapter 9&10 The War on Drugs vs. Harm Reduction These two chapters introduce the common two approaches to handling drug use issues in a society: zero tolerance and harm reduction. We discuss the effectiveness of these two approaches. Chapter 11&12 Health Consequences of Drug Taking These two chapters discuss the associated risks of drug taking, including HIV/AIDS and HCV contraction. We also discuss the effectiveness of the treatment of these drug-related diseases. Various topics in relation to drugs and culture, such as cocaine use, club drug use, ketamine use, misuse of prescription drugs, and use of new pharmaceutical products, such as Prozac and Viagra, are the selected topics for this course.\u00a0", "required_readings": "\u00a0 1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction to Drugs\u00a0\u00a0 Singer, Merrill. 2006. \u201cThe Colonial Era to Drug Criminalization.\u201d In Something Dangerous: Emergent and Changing Illicit Drug Use and Community Health, pp.35-54.

For example, aging or overpopulation in urban cities, environmental degradation, food and water resource crisis, large-scale voluntary and involuntary migration, and spread of communicable disease. A key goal of the course is to map out the linkages between population patterns, trends, and some of the socio-economic issues that occur locally, nationally, and at the global level which bring great challenges to our society. You will learn the concepts, theories, and data essential in the scientific study of the size, composition, and spatial distribution of human populations; and the changes that occur in these phenomena through the processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. You will gain an understanding of the roots of population structures, processes, and the consequences for individuals, family, and societies, and how it will affect and be affected by natural resources availability or depletion and health care system. Students will acquire the basic ability to analyze, explain and present the potential crisis facing the population system. In particular, this course will stimulate students\u2019 interest in understanding how the population could be linked to sustainable development, and reflect on the relationship between population growth and availability of resources, as well as the relationship between population and social institutional arrangements such as child and old care support, job supply and public asset distribution. In the end, students will learn to apply their skill and knowledge in proposing solutions for solving population-related challenges for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for example, zero hunger and no poverty, good health and well-being, reducing social inequality including gender inequality, maintaining decent work and economic development while developing more sustainable cities and communities.

Sustainable development is a global vision for the future.

Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.

Although English has long spread around the world, the consequences of this spread are only now beginning to be appreciated by speakers in diverse cultures and societies. English has changed the world, impacting specific local cultures in both positive and negative ways. But English has also been localized and acculturated, made to express the realities of diverse cultures and societies, and so the language has been changed in turn. The discourse of world Englishes aims to re-imagine our understanding of the language. The difference between error and innovation can no longer be decided by reference to \u2018ownership\u2019 of the language. Additionally, the language is beginning to be a medium of the expression of identity for more and more people in very different social and cultural contexts. World English must be pluralized, which is why we think in terms of world Englishes. This course is split into two sections. The first section will introduce you to issues in the discourse of world Englishes: innovation, variety, creativity, globalization, etc. The second section will look at specific case studies in different cultures and societies, and will focus on Asian Englishes, e.g. English in Singapore, China, and Japan. Different Asian cultures have distinct historical experiences with English, leading to different levels of cultural penetration (e.g. in popular culture) and depth of function (e.g. in business and law).

Because of environmental variations, some places are definitely better than the others for living and development. In the ancient time, man strived for searching a nice place for settlement which could provide a better resource base. Nowadays, man acquires sciences and technologies to change or even create the environment that makes living pleasant and comfortable. This course provides students with the insights needed to gain an understanding of ideal environment for living from a geographical perspective. Topics include environmental perception, siting and location, urbanization, land use and functions, urban planning, urban design, architecture and interior design. As the course examines the understanding of ideal environment for living from different angles, students will not only gain objective geographical knowledge about the relationship between man and environment, but also learn how some urban challenges and issues are tackled. While the coverage will be broad and pluralistic, examples and cases of mainland China and Hong Kong will be emphasized. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructors can guide students to analyze the cases and issues through queries and answers.", "outcome": "\u00a0 After taking this course, students are expected to:\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be aware of the environmental variations around the world\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be critical in the pursuit of better, if not ideal, environment for living\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be familiar with the development of city and the process of urbanization\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 appreciate the beauty and aesthetics of various human settlement forms\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 realize that man must best use his environment and natural resource base on a continuing basis\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0 This course portraits an image of ideal living environment from a geographical perspective.

Ironically, world hunger is increasing and FAO\u2019s most recent estimates put the number of hungry people at 822 million in 2018-19, an increase of more than 28 million since 2014-16, even though the technology of food production has improved significantly. Why? It is because the causes of world hunger are multiple and, in principle, include food availability, accessibility and utilization. The course therefore adopts a multidisciplinary approach to examine the different issues of food and hunger, and how they change with time. The causes of world hunger will be analyzed with special emphasis on food production systems, bearing in mind there is no single solution to the problem. Towards the end of the course, the development of sustainable agriculture and measures to mitigate the hunger problem in the 21st century will be addressed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Lectures will be supplemented with case studies, videos and slides.", "outcome": " Food is a basic need of human beings and food security is often assumed in an affluent society like Hong Kong.

The purpose of this course is to critically examine the common framing of Africa as a continent of conflict, disasters, poverty and a region that is perpetually in need of external intervention. In addition to the myth that surrounds Africa, there is a growing dynamics of activities resulting into the current interest on the continent. Earlier, the UN settled on the Agenda 2030 as a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity for the whole world. This plan dovetails very well with the Africa\u2019s Agenda 2063. This therefore provides an opportunity to identify where Africa situates on SDG issues that include its people, its environment and its economic development.The course will therefore present to students the context of Africa relating to its geography, environment, culture as well as contemporary development issues shaping the destiny of Africa. Through lectures, guest speakers, videos and possibly field studies, students will be able to critically evaluate the stereotypical notion of Africa as a continent rather than as a country as is quite often misconstrued. The course will provide an intellectual platform to understand and analyze issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective as they relate to Africa and humanity. The students will be able to interpret and explain in broad terms, the contemporary position of Africa as it relates to other parts of the world with special attention to its relationship with Asia and China in particular.", "outcome": " Through a variety of teaching and learning activities, including lectures, video shows, forum and group discussion on current issues, the student will be able to:  acquire basic knowledge of the physical, environmental and cultural geography of the African continent  embark on intellectual dialogues and critically analyze the theoretical and practical aspects of the people\u2019s relationship with the African physical environment.  students will understand the extent to which SDGs are integrated into the African development agenda  comment academically on issues, problems and challenges related to Africa.  demonstrate a greater understanding of Africa as a continent and its people;  think critically and academically in approaching the discussions on African issues  acquire the skills and capacity to provide necessary leadership and expertise to others seeking knowledge of and involvement in Africa and African affairs.", "syllabus": " 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From MDGs to SDGs: What\u2019s in it for Africa? 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: Overview of Africa-the Place, People and Culture 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ABCDE (African biodiversity conservation, degradation and extinction on Landscapes) (SDG 14 Life on Land) 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rural and Urban development in Africa (SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities) 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disasters, poverty and livelihood (SDG1 No Poverty/SDG2 Zero Hunger) 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People-land relations (SDG2 Zero Hunger/SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation) 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People \u2013 people relationship: the Role of religion (Islam and Christianity) (SDG5 Gender Equality/SDG16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institution) 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Africa overpopulated?/Water resources/Food security/Infrastructure (I)(SDG 6/SDG2/SDG9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Africa overpopulated?/Water resources/Food security/Infrastructure (II) )(SDG 6/SDG2/SDG9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) 10.\u00a0 \u00a0 Africa\u2019s Emerging economy (SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals) 11.\u00a0 \u00a0 China and Africa: Historical ties and contemporary issues (SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals)\u00a0", "required_readings": " PART 1-\u00a0Physical and environmental aspects of African continent Alan de Brauw, Valerie Mueller, Hak Lim Lee (2014).

The unprecedented pace of urbanization has recently witnessed a historic shift of human population with the majority now living in cities. The growth of cities in this age of globalization raises many opportunities and challenges, concerning the quality of life, poverty, sustainability, environmental degradation and urban competitiveness. All of which deserve our attention.This course offers students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges from the perspective of sustainable development. It examines the historical, social, economic, cultural and environmental dimensions of cities. As the course focuses on urban issues at global, regional and local levels, students will not only gain knowledge about the causes and impacts of urban problems, but also learn how different stakeholders can help achieve sustainable liveable cities in the age of globalization. By adopting an issue-based approach, different SDGs such as no poverty (SDG 1), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequality (SDG 10) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), will be included in a variety of topics ranging from socio-economic to environmental aspects in the course. Different cities will be chosen as case studies for understanding various urban challenges and solutions. Apart from lectures, students will develop critical thinking on various urban challenges that affect their daily lives through video discussion, group projects and presentation in the discussion forums.", "outcome": " This course will offer students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges.

How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5).

This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to global politics, focusing in particular on its origins and historical evolution, its key concepts, major theoretical frameworks, main actors and institutions, the global architecture of power, and its dynamic nature in the process of globalization. It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies. The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global politics.This course intends to promote students\u2019 appreciation of the role of \u2018power\u2019, \u2018security\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 in shaping the global political order nowadays. Students will gain deeper insights into not only latest developments in global political affairs, but also concepts and theories useful for further studies in politics, international relations, and global political economy. The course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic mechanisms of global political order, allowing students to communicate issues in world politics effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to: \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Describe the evolution of the global political order and identify how power relations is related to the peace and security of world politics;

This course aims to provide students the foundational knowledge on the operation of world economy and examine how social, political and institutional factors contribute to the creation of global economic order. It examines the intertwining and interaction of economics (wealth creation) and politics (political power) in global affairs.The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Political Economy (GPE) (Liberalism, Mercantilism, and Marxist theory, etc.). In the second part, we cover substantive policy issues including international trade and monetary system, foreign investment and multi-national corporations, etc.. It focuses on how the world economy is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on the development of various international and regional institutions that govern the current economic order. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global economic governance, with a particular focus on the transforming role of national states and the endeavors of international development on poverty and inequality reduction.

This course talks about the characteristics and functioning of news, and its important role and functions in society. News is vital to us as it brings latest information of the day, helps create public opinion, educate our young generations, monitor the government and the powerful, as well as provide relaxation to our busy lives. To understand the news can essentially help us know our society. Various concepts and theories from the mass communication discipline are introduced together with some perspectives from other social sciences. Real-life examples from Hong Kong and abroad are analyzed.Students are first introduced to the unique nature of news and different types of news as found in both print and electronic media. Some new news formats, including free dailies, online newspapers, network social media and citizen journalism, are discussed in both international and local contexts. Relationships between journalism and closely related professions such as advertising and public relations are explicated in order to understand the actual functioning of news, as well as its impact on society. The professional concerns of the field of journalism and individual\u2019s news consumption habits are also highlighted in the course.After taking this course, students will be able to understand more about news and its relationship with the society.

The first part sets the stage by examining the relationship between news and society, the nature and characteristics of news, as well as inviting students to reflect on their news reading habits. The second part deals with various major types of news, including social news, political news, entertainment news, and international news. The third part is about some emerging news trends in society, including the rapid rise of free newspapers, online newspapers and the new social network media as news channels. The final part discusses institutional relationships among news, advertising, public relations, and other social sectors. The reflection on journalistic professionalism and media ethics serve to round up and highlight the role and responsibilities of news in society.\u00a0The following is an outline of this course:\u00a0Week 1\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyThe course starts by introducing the role of journalism as a vital social institution and its unique function as the often-quoted \"fourth estate\" of the government. But in fact news serves to monitor the government and the society, and thus freedom of the press is important not only to the journalists but to the general public. Contribution of newswork to the proper maintenance of the public sphere and establishment of a civil society is emphasized.\u00a0Key concepts: journalism as social institution, journalism as the fourth estate, press freedom, public sphere\u00a0Week 2\u00a0\u00a0 What is News: Characteristics and PerspectivesNews is a complex social phenomenon. It is so familiar to us but yet a simple and clear definition cannot be satisfactorily reached among academics and practitioners. Many agree that \"immediacy\", \"importance\" and \"interest\" are the three most important components. Others see news as some sort of deviant events. Some scholars regard news as vital social information while others think of it as a commercial product. Objectivity can be regarded as a noble ideal but some say it is a \"strategic ritual\". Scholars from the humanistic tradition would treat it primarily as a \"speech act\".\u00a0Key concepts: definitions of news, the three \u201cIs\u201d of news, news as deviance, objectivity as strategic ritual, news net, humanistic perspectives of news\u00a0Week 3\u00a0\u00a0 Cultivating Good News Reading HabitsNews consumption patterns were stable in the past but are now showing great changes due to the coming of the Internet age. People tend to read less print newspapers and spend more time getting information online. This is especially true for the younger generations who practically grow up together with the Internet. How can we instill the value of news reading to the young people? How can they become smarter readers, no matter which news venues/channels they tune to? New technologies are a threat to existing media but they also open up new opportunities and possibilities. It is essential for our students to be news literate in order to become an informed and critical citizen.\u00a0Key concepts: changing news use patterns, news consumer, critical citizenship, media education, technological impact\u00a0Week 4\u00a0\u00a0 Social News: Taste Strata of Mass and EliteNews about the society can vary according to the orientations of news organizations and the tastes of the reading/viewing public. The elite class has different taste preference over news when compared with the mass public. Fierce competition and marketization have driven many news organizations to go down the road of tabloidization and McDonaldization. They tend to hype the news and respond more to market \"wants\" instead of social \"needs\".\u00a0Key concepts: tabloidization, McDonaldization, market driven-journalism, hyping\u00a0Week 5\u00a0\u00a0 Political News: Monitoring Those in PowerNews is always intertwined with the government, politicians and those who have power in society. Various political forces want to control or influence the press in order to gain advantages. They feed and spin stories to the media, which on the other hand try to play the watchdog function and report news responsibly. News coverage in election settings will be examined to see how journalists and politicians interact with each other, and whether the public is properly informed.\u00a0Key concepts: spin doctoring, watchdog function, social responsibility theory, media and election, stereotyping\u00a0Week 6\u00a0\u00a0 Entertainment News: \"Interesting\", Not \"Public Interest\" Some people love entertainment news. They are keen on the \"interesting\" acts of or self-directed promotion by certain celebrities and have little concern over \"public interest\". As a result, entertainment news tends to be trivial or muckraking. The paparazzi teams sent by news organizations could not care less about invasion of privacy or damaging celebrities' reputations. The blurring of boundaries (between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, public and private, etc.) is something we should be aware of when reading this type of news.\u00a0Key concepts: trivialization, paparazzi, personal muckraking, blurring of boundaries, invasion of privacy\u00a0Week 7\u00a0\u00a0 International News: Our Window on the WorldThe course will talk about international news as the world is getting more and more global and integrated. It is essentially our window to look at the world outside. Between nations, diplomacy is often done through news reporting, which significantly reflects national interests. The major international news agencies play an important role. Journalists usually try hard to \"domesticate\" foreign news to make it more attractive to local audience.\u00a0Key concepts: media and national interest, public policy, media diplomacy, domestication of news\u00a0Week 8\u00a0\u00a0 Free Newspapers: The New Model That WorksTraditionally, TV is free but newspaper is paid. But in the past few decades, paid TV channels have quickly emerged as well as free newspapers. Print newspapers rely on both advertising and subscription or single copy sales. This business model is upset by the free newspapers which rely solely on advertising. People find that being free is irresistible, and they are less concerned about the quantity and quality of news as long as it is free of charge. What are the implications for the future of journalism? Would it popularize newspaper reading or downgrade the quality of journalism, or both? How do free dailies, paid dailies and online dailies interact? These are evolving issues worthy of closer examination.\u00a0Key concepts: distribution-driven journalism, free vs. paid, Metro Daily formula, work-habitation patterns, interactions among different types of newspapers\u00a0Week 9\u00a0\u00a0 Online Newspapers: News in the Internet AgeGoing online is a relatively new phenomenon for the press starting in the mid-1990s. It began as a low-cost spin-off that carried big promises both in terms of revenue and readership. The actual result favors the latter but not the former, and the journalism industry is still seeking a workable business model for online newspapers. But onlineDailies do revolutionize news delivery and its content because of its electronic and digital format. A new marketplace is forged but its potential has not been fully realized. Whether online newspapers would eventually replace the print versions remains an intriguing question for both the academics and the practitioners.\u00a0Key concepts: electronic marketplace, information marketplace, opinion marketplace, virtual media space, media format\u00a0Week 10 Social Network Media as News ChannelsIn the past decade, new social network media have become so popular that they also begin to act as news source and serve as a platform for news dissemination. What are their relationships with traditional news organizations? How do they affect the nature, delivery and quality of news? Scholars differentiate the role of traditional journalists as \"gatekeeping\" from the new role of online journalists as \"gatewatching\". Is citizen journalism in the Internet age a blessing or a curse? Would there be generational differences? All these questions will be explored in the course.\u00a0Key concepts: alternative media, Facebook, Twitter, blogging, citizen journalism, gatekeeping, gatewatching\u00a0Week 11\u00a0News and Advertising: Any Strings Attached with the Money?News and advertising seem to be inseparable worldwide. Journalists work together with advertising and marketing people to bring both news and product information to the readers/audiences. But the journalistic side and the market side of a news organization have different and even opposing ideals and goals. They are in constant battle but have to rely on the other for survival. How can news be immune from unwanted advertising influence? Why is public broadcasting possible but not public print journalism?\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic theory vs. market theory, theory of low involvement, types of advertising, commercialization, sponsorship \u00a0Week 12 News and Public Relations: How to Influence the PressJournalists and public relations people constitute another pair of actors in constant tension and cooperation. Journalists need news sources and public relations practitioners provide news and information to news organizations. But public relations people are often accused of staging pseudo-events in order to gain publicity and propaganda. They try to influence the press and get coverage. In recent years, many journalists leave the profession and join the public relations field as they know how news work and how to gain press coverage. It is an interesting topic and has major implications for the content and quality of news reporting.\u00a0Key concepts: pseudo-events, staging, manufacturing consent, propaganda model\u00a0Week 13 Rethinking News: Professionalism, Ethics, and AlternativesThis week is a wrap-up of the course by focusing on media professionalism and ethics. How can journalists do their job properly under all sorts of constraints? Can they adhere to a high standard of media ethics? Can news reflects different perspectives and interests in the society? Is the noble ideal of public journalism a viable alternative? How can news better serve our society and the general public? It is hoped that students will be able to reflect on these questions through the readings and the various assignments in this course.\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic professionalism, media ethics, multi-perspectival news, public journalism ", "required_readings": "Required readings:Week 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyWerner, W., & Nixon, K.

We will review and discuss how various factors have contributed to the invention and development of communication fads. \u00a0 Week 3 Mediated memories: How we remember and are remembered? Communication technologies have been important memory devices in human history. We will trace how communication technologies co-evolved with memory practices. \u00a0 Week 4 Social media: How we connect and are connected? What media are not \u201csocial media\u201d? Media always facilitate networking in different forms. We will reconsider what differentiates the social media we know of today from previous generations of social media. \u00a0 Week 5 Dating apps and romance  The meanings of \u2018romance\u2019 and \u2018intimacy\u2019 have undergone sweeping changes with the advent of dating apps in smartphones. In this class, we will examine the features of these apps and uncover their assumptions underlying \u2018love\u2019. \u00a0 Week 6 MOOC and learning  Massive Open Online Courses are introducing new forms of teaching, learning and academic accreditation. In a broader sense, how has Internet transformed learning? We will critically evaluate some popular claims in this aspect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 7 KOL and public opinions Key Opinion Leaders are also known as social influencers or sometimes internet celebrities. They are seen to exert increasing influence in \u2018public opinions\u2019 or \u2018public sentiments\u2019.\u3000In this class, we will revisit earlier communication theory regarding two-step flow of information and see how Internet has brought new practices in shaping public opinions.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 8 Streaming media and entertainment  In this class, we will focus on the case of streaming media and discuss how entertainment is changed in the Internet era. We will also consider how this in turn affects the production, distribution and consumption of media products. \u00a0 Week 9 - 10 Haters and comment culture Comment culture is a notable Internet phenomenon. Instead of looking at \u2018likes\u2019, we focus on the mechanisms behind \u2018dislikes\u2019 and the behaviors of \u2018haters\u2019.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 11 Protest mobilization and social movements Internet is seen to be a key factor in protest mobilization. We will examine some key elements in social movements and discuss how social media, for example, have contributed (or not) in the mobilization process.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 12 Surveillance and sensor society  The classic \u2018big brother\u2019 thesis is discussed with a careful consideration of many emerging practices in surveillance and self-surveillance. The idea of \u2018sensor society\u2019 will be introduced to see how we are (in)voluntarily contributing to a productive surveillance culture.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 13 Hello future!  In this final class, we will reconsider the two central themes of convergence and participation and make both informed and wild guesses for the future. \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " Week 1 Phenomena, problems and issues \u00a0 Jenkins, H.

How the progressive ideas of sex and violence can enter the social realm of discussion through media representation will also be studied.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The course explores media representation as a powerful tool in perpetuating certain social reality in the following aspects: (1) it is additive to existing cultural values; (2) it supplements face-to-fact communication; and (3) the representation is monopolized (one-sided). The course also aims to sharpen students' sensitivity to the social reality that media representation of sex and violence as a commercial product is largely an outcome of the reliance of media organizations on advertising money as the funding source. In other words, the imperative of such media representation (a commercial product) is rooted in the particular socio-economic structures of commercial media organization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The notion of \"power\" will also be studied in the following aspects: (1) it shapes our understanding of gender roles and \"just\" use of violence; (2) media organization is structurally more resourceful than the audience; (3) media representation of sex and violence is carefully constructed to appear as the \"normal\"/\"natural\"; and (4) the constructive nature of media representation is hidden.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topics (subject to change by the instructor)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction and getting to know each other\u00a0Media and Society\u00a0What's wrong with advertising?\u00a0Anything wrong with newspapers?\u00a0Aesthetics of violence and gender differences\u00a0Violence at a distance\u00a0Sex Industry I-Sex Workers\u00a0Sex Industry 11-Pornography and Erotica\u00a0Beauty is the beast?\u00a0Men from Mars, Women from Venus?\u00a0Gender and Intimate Relationships\u00a0Women are no longer the weaker sex?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Course Pack Materials:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1:\u00a0Read: \"Sex and Violence Don't Sell\"\u00a0Read: \"Yellow Journalism\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2: Media and Society\u00a0Read: \"Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action\"\u00a0Read: \"True Crime: The Origins of Modem Sensationalism\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3: What's wrong with advertising?\u00a0Read: \"Advertising: The magic system\"\u00a0Read: \"Handling Sex\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4: Anything wrong with our newspapers?\u00a0Read: \"Modern Communication: Enlargement and Animation\"\u00a0Read: \"Social Production of News\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 5: Aesthetics of violence and gender differences\u00a0Read: \"Racism and the Aesthetic of Hyperreal Violence\"\u00a0Read: \"Aestheticization of violence\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 6: Violence at a distance\u00a0Read: \"Regarding the pain of others\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 9: Sex Industry I-Sex Workers\u00a0Read: \"Self-employment and 'Professionalism\"'\u00a0Read: \"Sex Worker\"\u00a0Read: \"Multiple Stigma, Discrimination and Violence\"\u00a0www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/TorontoPosters/instigmamsmfsw.pdf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 10: Sex Industry 11\u2500Pornography and Erotica\u00a0Read: \"Pornography and Male Supremacy7'\u00a0Read: \"Misguided, Dangerous and Wrong: An Analysis of Anti-pornography politics\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 11: Beauty is the beast?\u00a0Read: \"Beauty is the Beast\"\u00a0Read: \"Looking good: The psychology and Biology of Beauty\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 12: Men from Mars, Women from Venus?\u00a0Read: \"Masculinity\"\u00a0Read: \"Constructing Perfect Women\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 13: Gender and Intimate Relationships\u00a0Read: \"Preface to the Fourth Edition, 1891\u00a0Read: \"Intimacy Transformed?\"\u00a0Read: \"The mating game\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 14: Women are no longer the weaker sex?\u00a0Read: \"Sports, Media and Stereotypes\"\u00a0Read: www.batteredmen.com\u00a0Read: \"Battered Men?

With the advent of the new media technology, new forms of organizational crisis emerge. They are called Internet-mediated crises.

This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises.

Several crisis and non-crisis cases will be used for comparisons and discussions. At the end of the class, the students should be able to grasp the core characteristics of a crisis and the types of crisis commonly occurred in modern societies. Key concepts: Crisis vs. problem, types of crisis, crisis impacts \u00a0 Week 2 The stakeholder theory and the four models of public relations \u00a0 The class teaches Freeman (1984)\u2019s stakeholder theory. It proffers the students an overview of the scope of the stakeholder groups that an organization may need to handle in crisis communication and communication. It then introduces Grunig and Hunt\u2019s (1984) four models of public relations to give students a framework in viewing the relationships between organizations and stakeholders. Consequences of ignoring these relationships will be examined through the use of real crisis cases. Key concepts: The stakeholder theory, four models of public relations \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 3 The public, the media and the new media \u00a0 The class examines the evolution of the public demand and expectation on organizations in general and in times of crisis. The role of the media in shaping public opinion in crisis is also discussed. It also examines the impact of the advent of the new media technology on crisis communication and management. Online public forums on crisis cases will be studied. Key concepts: The critical mass, the media, the new media, the social media \u00a0 Week 4 Blog-related crisis in modern societies. \u00a0 Blog-related crises include crises initiated or facilitated by personal blogs. The class examines rumor and fact types of blog-related crises. To demonstrate, several recent examples are used illustrate the huge impact of public comments on blogs. Factors that contribute to effective blog-related crisis management are discussed. Key concepts: blogs, word-of-mouth and blogosphere \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 5\u00a0 and 6 Pre-crisis planning \u00a0 The class teaches a crucial stage in crisis management: Pre-crisis alert and planning. A good pre-crisis preparation may save an organization from a crisis. As such, students will be taught risk assessment, early detection and planning in the pre-crisis stage. Organizational structures and cultures that facilitate down-up reporting are necessary in early detection. Organizations that are particularly prone to crisis will be discussed. The importance of pre-crisis detection on the Internet and tools for monitoring will also be discussed. Key concepts: pre-crisis stage, crisis planning, risk assessment, organizational structures, organizational cultures \u00a0 Week 7 and 8 Crisis communication and management \u00a0 Benoit\u2019s (1995) image restoration theory and Coombs\u2019 (1999) on-going crisis theory will be used to build theoretical frameworks in conceptualizing crisis communication and management. The class also examines the principles in making news to give students some guidelines about what to say and do in times of crisis, especially upon media enquiry. Good and bad examples of crisis communication management will be used for comparison and contrast. Key concepts: crisis communication and management, image restoration theory, ongoing crisis, the making of news \u00a0 Week 9 and 10 Post-crisis communication \u00a0 Post-crisis communication is as important as crisis management because it determines how successful an organization is in restoring its image and reputation. It examines what is needed to be done for an organization to rebuild the lost trust. Several crisis cases will be used to investigate this topic. The students will explore on what constitutes a good post-crisis communication in this post-modern era. Key concepts: post-crisis communication \u00a0 Week 11 Guest speaker \u00a0 An expert in crisis communication and management will be invited to give a talk to students. \u00a0 Week 12 and 13 Corporate social responsibility, sustainability and crisis \u00a0 The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) will be introduced. Cases showing the increased public demand on corporate social responsibility will be presented. The evolution of the concepts of CSR will also be discussed. The class will then examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility and pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis management.

SUBLIMINAL PERSUASION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Week 1: Subliminal Messaging and Materialism \u00a0 This week will introduce briefly all three sections and emphasis more specifically on subliminal persuasion, using materialism, luxury branding in China as examples. China has replaced Japan as the second strongest economic power in the world in 2012. It has also surpassed the US to become the second largest luxury brand market in 2009, spending of $9.4 billion and accounting for 27.5% of total global sales of luxury brands in the world. The invasion of luxury brands will inevitably alter the spending culture in China. Luxury brand ads hint subtly that consumers using them belong to a higher social group in the society. Students will discuss the subliminal indicators of luxury brand ads and their effects on attitudes towards social status in the society.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 2: Commercialization of Friendship in Social Networking Sites \u00a0 Social networking sites are dominating the media landscape among young people. Many viral ads are circulated through the disguise of sincere recommendations from friends, who actually share information for an incentive. This class will look into the core of this issue: should friendship be commercialized for personal gains? \u00a0 Week 3: Properties, Personal Loan Ads and Wealth \u00a0 The recent waves of glamorized Hong Kong properties ads disseminated in China led to grave consequences in raising the prices of flats in Hong Kong. The property ads In Hong Kong shape unrealistic desires in viewers to own a flat that demands a lifetime of hard earned salaries. Personal loan ads encourage a supposedly free life of spending with no responsibility. This lesson will discuss the dynamics of these subliminal messages in affecting one\u2019s decision about how to spend his / her money. \u00a0 Week 4: Political Campaigns and Elections \u00a0 The presence of political campaigns in commercial media becomes prevalent these days due to the rise of democratization in the election process. This lesson will look into the various tactics and subliminal strategies used and manipulated in political advertising and its effects on public participation in election. \u00a0 II. MEDIATION OF REALITY \u00a0 Week 5: Beauty Ads and Body Image \u00a0 This lesson will start with an in-depth look at the concept of mediation of reality, using studies conducted in Hong Kong that relate beauty and slimming product / service ads to a negative self-perceived body image in both men and women. Teenagers, in particular, are finding their self in their growing years by comparing themselves to the models in the ads. The gap between the idealized self and actual self creates frustrations among many. To bridge the gap, some fall for crash diets and some for desperate acts of plastic surgeries. \u00a0 Week 6: Stereotypical Sex Ads and Gender Roles \u00a0 This lesson looks into the relationship between commoditization and objectification of the body and the resultant stereotypical roles played by men and women. Students will be challenged to live beyond the fixed roles narrowly defined and presented in the pseudo-reality. \u00a0 Week 7: Tutor King / Queen Ads and Education \u00a0 The educational system in Hong Kong requires students to acquire incessant training and upgrading. Many tutors chanced this opportunity to create fast track learning to success by advertising their success rate of getting a student to obtain an As. This form of promotion alters students\u2019 mentality to learning. Tutors acting as opinion leaders in ads create a trend of commercialized education. \u00a0 Week 8: A \u201cCopycat\u201d Culture \u00a0 \u201cCopycat\u201d China refers not only to the many cases of copying of products but also the imitation of ideas and other intellectual properties in China. Advertising is an industry that is keen on creativity, the very core element that sustains the industry. Piracy will suffocate the creative industry in the long run. Students will scan the creative landscape in China and learn to identify the seemingly original creative reality. \u00a0 III. INFUSION OF CONSTRUCTED MEANINGS \u00a0 Week 9: Freedom of Speech and the Press  This class will start examining the idea about meaning and value driven advertising/ advocacy. Recent cases show that advertising is affecting the press in Hong Kong and the Mainland has been censoring a lot of ads online and outdoor. What is the value of commercial speech? How much would the commercial speech be compromised? Will the censorship erode creativity, global branding strategy and business development? Students will investigate the longstanding struggle of the protection of speech in Hong Kong and the mainland. \u00a0 Week 10: Globalizing and Standardization \u00a0 Global brands launched by global advertising agencies bring about their unique culture from the country-of-origin into a foreign country. For a global brand to be successfully adopted by local citizens, the agencies need to accommodate the traditional culture. However, the global influence for standardization sometimes surpasses localization, resulting in a pervasive infusion of foreign values. The balance and consideration of both cultures are the center of discussion in this lesson. A few global campaigns around the world will be presented to demonstrate the delicate balance between globalization and localization. \u00a0 Week 11: \u201cAnti\u201d Campaigns and Social Movements \u00a0 This lesson will look into the value-driven impact and of Public Service Announcements (PSAs), including the anti-smoking, anti-drug and anti-AIDS campaigns on society. The lesson will also focus on the development, planning and execution of those campaigns. It is the purpose of the lesson to raise the awareness of the students in these cause advertising campaigns. \u00a0 Week 12: Earth Hour, Outdoor Light Pollution and other Green Campaigns \u00a0 Greenpeace and other environmental protection groups have been working on major campaigns to improve the living conditions of the world. A few successful green campaigns will be discussed in class to reveal their value shifting strategies. \u00a0 Week 13: Food, Drug Ads and Public Health \u00a0 World Health Organization has established the strong tie between advertising of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food and obesity. While UK has exercised blanket ban of food advertising to children and many other countries following suit, the Broadcasting Authority in Hong Kong has only advised five cases in the past four years regarding HFSS food ads to children. This lesson will investigate the difficult path to policy change in the business sector in Hong Kong. Advertising of all medicinal products in Hong Kong is strictly controlled by the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap 231) (the UMAO). Section 3 of the UMAO provides for an outright prohibition against the publication of 'any advertisement likely to lead to the use of any medicine \u2026 for the purpose of treating \u2026 or preventing' any disease, disorder or abnormal physical state. However, some prominent direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads are produced and broadcasted in Hong Kong recently. DTC drug advertising will change the traditional beliefs towards doctor-patient relationship and the demand of name-brand drugs at the expense of generic or equally effective drugs. Students will explore the Campaigns of Gardasil and Cervarix to find out their use of Government bodies as fa\u00e7ade to lure the public to consult doctors about the drugs.", "required_readings": " Tentative Reading List \u00a0 I.

Culture is ubiquitous in every aspect of societies, including how we do business. This course will examine the role of culture in contemporary business and study work and management in industrial societies anthropologically. Students will be introduced to the cultural logics of business practices, particularly business operations, organization and management through ethnographic explorations of different cultures, locales and sociohistorical settings. The aims of the course are twofold. First, it reveals cultural aspects and the cultural mechanisms of business. It shows the significance of culture in the business world, as well as the cultural significance of business. Second, it attempts to put anthropology into business practice. It demonstrates to students how anthropological knowledge and methodologies can be applied to business operations and help to achieve business goals. By examining the themes including but not limited to the indoctrination of work ethics, labor relations, gender and racial issues in the workplace, capitalism and its discontents, and responses to and actions upon market capitalism in terms of both production and consumption, the course attends to these Sustainable Development Goals: No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).", "outcome": " After the completion of this course, students will:  Understand and appreciate the cultural dimensions of business operations and organization in different historical, political, and social settings;  Acquire the necessary ethnographic skills to study diverse aspects of business operations and organization;  Be able to rethink and challenge the existing assumptions regarding business practices in the modern world;  Gain the analytical tools to examine issues of over-consumption, over-production, dispossession, oppression, and other relevant discontent under global capitalism;  Be able to examine critically the role SDGs could play in addressing disparities and injustices in the world;  Understand the importance of building a more inclusive, equal and diverse society. \u00a0", "syllabus": " The course is structured in three parts. Part I Culture in Business explores the cultural dimensions of workplaces and corporate management. We begin with an overview of the temporal and spatial reconfigurations since industrialization in order to discern modern work ethics, followed by explorations of dynamics in the workplace. Next, we will explore discourses in shaping corporate operations and management, and consider (and challenge) the ideas of economization, maximization, auditing and accountability. This part decodes life in business settings, and practices in corporations. Part II Business Ventures in the Globalizing World situates the discussions in current trends of capitalism. We will look into what makes us buy and spend, and how traditional values and modern business practices mingle. It raises the question of whether we are really emancipated under the fashion of decentralization by exploring the gig economy and the phenomenon of self-enterprising. We will also examine how we can build a more inclusive, diverse and equal society by finding a new way out from the existing business ideologies and practices. Part III Anthropology and the Business World discusses how to apply anthropology in business settings, looking into how and why anthropology and anthropologists are important to the private sector, and broadly speaking, to the modern capitalist world. The course concludes by contemplating whether business is really business. Overall, through the examinations of how we are taught to work, produce, and buy, the imperative of gender and racial stereotypes in the workplace, turns in capitalism and the rise of new economies and the pertinent social and cultural phenomena, the course addresses the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): No Poverty (SDG#1), Gender Equality (SDG#5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG#10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12), and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG#17).

This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked \u201csmart\u201d-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes\u2014the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us \u2018more\u2019 human than previous forms of cultural life. ", "outcome": "\u00a0 \u00a0 After taking this course students will have learnt how to design and perform online fieldwork and manage digital referencing.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will know of and understand the recent history and development of the internet and key platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, eBay, iTunes, and the ways in which cyberspace has become embedded in the everyday work and social lives of over 2.4 billion internet users.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will be able to explain and discuss the various debates on the social consequences of online technologies with regard to the tensions between online lives and (so called) real lives, or digital dualism.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will be able to address and articulate issues of political and philosophical change, activism, addiction, surveillance, the body and visual culture in connection to mobile technologies.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will know of some philosophical discussions on the nature of humanity in this new epoch. The question of humanity, posthuman futures, and transhumanism is a key concern that runs throughout the course. Students will also come to consider social media and our changing digital cultures as deeply significant to new understandings of gender and body identity.\u00a0", "syllabus": " \u00a0Core Content\u00a0  Online Field Work \u2013 Exploring how researchers have performed social research online. This will equip students with a knowledge of the approaches, techniques and challenges of field work in cyberspace. Whilst being a core topic, this is also part of the weekly project work of the course. Students will start \u00a0\u00a0their digital research from the beginning of the course, by first developing a blog and networking with classmates.  Cultural History of Cyberspace \u2013 How did the world go online? This topic addresses the historical and technological developments that led the world to go online. Its key concern is to highlight how this has altered and affected society, and how quickly online life has become a part of everyday life.  Social Networking Sites \u2013 The rise of web 2.0 and how the internet has become social. How have different SNS emerged, how do they connect, isolate, liberate, and limit social activity? Online Culture is explored via the different uses of various SNS platforms, and their own identities.  Sex and Body Culture in Cyberspace \u2013 Tackles the social consequences of online pornography in different social and cultural circumstances. Body politics, risk, and sexuality online.  Posthumanism \u2013 This is framed in the first week as a key issue and returns as the focus of the last 2 weeks of the course.This topic looks at the impact of cyberspace on our philosophical understanding of our bodies and ourselves. How is technology changing our attitudes to gender, ethnicity, religion, and is it making us more or less human?  Online Activism \u2013 Explores the relationship between cyberspace and participatory politics, social justice, terror, and extremist groups Proposed weekly topics with core content highlighted.\u00a0 Week 1:- Introduction: Starting Digital Research (Going Viral) Week 2:- Cultural History of Cyberspace Week 3:- Social Networking Sites Week 4:- Sex and Body Culture in Cyberspace Week 5:- Video Gaming Culture \u2013 Play & Recreation Week 6 :- Internet Addiction Week 7:- Online Activism Week 8:- Cyber-Surveillance and Crime Week 9:- Online Field Work Week 10:- Free Software, Inclusion, and Sharing Week 11:- Virtual, Real, and Hybrid Space Week 12:- The Selfie, the Self and Posthumanism Week 13:- Future Scenarios of Cyberspace Thematics: Online Research is covered as part of project work throughout the course. Weekly work on blogs relate to class discussions and require students to source and reference. It is addressed as a key topic in Week 1 & Week 9. Social Consequences of online lives as a theme is most strongly represented in the topics of week 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11. As well, because of the salience of this topic it \u00a0relates to other core topics such as 3,4,7, 11, and 12. Posthumanism is a philosophical theme that is introduced in Week 1 and is relevant throughout the course. It is tackled directly as a concluding theme in the final two weeks of the course (12 and 13). \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " \u00a0\u00a0 Week 1 - Introduction: Starting Digital Research (Going Viral) Miller, Daniel and Heather Horst, \u201cThe Digital and the Human: A Prospectus for Digital Anthropology\u201d, in Digital Anthropology, ed.

It is an interesting site where complex global processes can be traced. Flows of capital, film personnel, technologies, ideas and creativity are vibrantly circulating inside and outside the cultural industry of filmmaking, resulting in phenomena such as transnational co-productions and cross-cultural cooperations. These dynamic processes are inflected in characterization, plot development, and space-time configurations on Hong Kong screens. This course takes students on an interdisciplinary exploration of the local-global interactions from a variety of approaches. With a selection of Hong Kong films, the course aims to help students attain a thorough understanding of the two-way relationship between the local, popular entertainment and the global film scene by investigating the major questions concerning globalization.

The issue is further complicated by the recent debate on the social responsibilities and economic sustainability of the URA. On the economic side, affected property owners and tenants are concerned about compensation while there are effects on the revitalized economy of the area particularly in major comprehensive redevelopment projects.

We all want good health, effective treatments of illness and affordable health care. Yet we are faced with many challenges and controversies in our pursuit of good health: glaring inequality in health and longevity, the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle, the conflicts between patients and doctors, the uncertainty of medical treatments and medical knowledge, and the ever-increasing health care spending. In this course, we dissect these issues from the perspectives of social sciences. We first assess the social determinants of health and illness and examine the following topics: the social distribution of health and illness, societal inequality and health, social networks, social capital and health, health lifestyle and public policy, and the interaction between genetics and social environment. We then address the social organization of health and health care and discuss the following topics: the social construction of health and illness, the social context of patient-doctor relationship, and the social organization of healthcare systems. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the current COVID-19 pandemic and use it to illustrate how social and cultural factors influence health and well-being. This course helps the students understand and relate to the following UN sustainable development goals: SDG#3 good health and well-being, SDG#10 reduced inequalities and peace, SDG#16 justice and strong institutions. By illuminating the social and cultural determinants of health and well-being, this course will enrich the students\u2019 understanding of what contributed to good health and well-being, of the unequal distribution of health and well-being, and of the role of social and political institutions in producing health. It also seeks to motivate the students to think about public policies and social interventions that may promote health and well-being, reduce social disparities in health and strengthen health-promoting institutions.

Living Feminisms is all about how to put feminism into practice. Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). ", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will acquire both knowledge and skills of social change that are in line with feminist consciousness. Specifically, they will be able to explain the roots of the domination system and a series of factors contributing to its perpetuation, and able to make change by transforming internal and external resistance. Students will be empowered to take lead in change effort through collaboration with others and mastery of conflict transformation skills.\u00a0Students will learn to appreciate making a sustainable future requires transformation in areas broader than the conventionally defined economic realm.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " Class 1: How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Riane Eisler and Douglas P.

This course examines the gender dimensions of innovation and novelty. The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology.

This course examines the rich tradition of feminist film theory and provides students with an understanding of its main concerns and debates. Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object \u201cto-be-looked-at,\u201d in Laura Mulvey\u2019s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s pictures\u201d and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women\u2019s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films \u201ccut to the measure of [male] desire.\u201d Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3224", "title": "Family and Society", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009. \nNot for Gender Studies Majors; and students who have taken GDRS3009 or SOCI2218(3222). \nCo-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "(UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009.)

Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion.

Educational and occupational accomplishments vary dramatically among individuals and profoundly affect lives.

This course is designed to introduce to students, with a critical mindset, important contemporary issues at the intersection of gender, education and jobs. The topics address the role of gender in school- and related preferences and achievements, with a focus on social and cognitive approaches. For example, what is quality education (SDG goal 4) and why is it important to evaluate it with a gender perspective? Do men and women really differ in their abilities, and if so, by how much? Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3482", "title": "Film and Cultural Politics in Southeast Asia", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture\nInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGEC3482 is double-coded with CURE3033. \nNot for Cultural Studies; Religious Studies Majors; and students who have taken CURE3033.\nCo-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "(UGEC3482 is double-coded with CURE3033.)

The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge regarding the ten questions to be asked and answered in the course.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following is an outline of the course:(1) Introduction: The formation of Hong Kong Culture, a historical overviewThe lecture will trace the formation and changes of Hong Kong culture from the 1950s to the 2010s, relating social changes to the cultural changes of audio-visual texts produced in different periods of time. Key concepts will be introduced to help students make sense of cultural patterns as articulated in movies and television programs. Key concepts: textuality, contextuality, media representations(2) The Birth of Hong Kong ManThe lecture will focus on the cultural differentiations of mainlanders and Hongkongers in the 1970s. Students will think about the question of why Hong Kong people, mostly ethnic Chinese, saw themselves as a rather different social group of their own. A few classic texts will be used to illustrate the logic of \"othering\" and stigmatizing mainlanders.Key concepts: \"other\", cultural imaginations, stigma(3) New Wave Film and Colonial PoliticsThe lecture will introduce some basic concepts of colonialism. Some mainstream texts will be contrasted with some new wave movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some patterns of colonial articulations and de-articulations will be illustrated by these mainstream and new wave productions.Key concepts: colonialism, marginality(4) Political Metaphors in TV and FilmThe lecture will explain the reasons why there were quite of lot of political metaphors in television and films produced in the 1990s. The relations between political censorship, social anxiety and polysemic articulations will be elaborated with significant cases.Key concepts: polysemy, metaphor, censorship(5) Nonsense and Nostalgia, Remembering and ForgettingThe lecture will explain the nature of mediated collective memories and the social functions they perform. The rise of nostalgic texts in the 1990s will be contrasted with the discourses of collective memories in the 2000s.Key concepts: nostalgia, collective memories(6) Urban Space & Postmodern City The lecture will trace the changes in urban representations in films and television from the 1980s up to recent years when discourses concerning urban developments and cultural preservations are competing for public attention.Key concepts: urban imaginations, postmodernity, space and place(7) Media Events: 1997 and 1st July The lecture will introduce the theory of \"media events\" and apply it to major turning points of Hong Kong society such as July 1st in 1997 and 2003, SARS, the Sichuan earthquake, etc. The changes of Hong Kong culture will be examined by looking into the configurations of major media events in recent years.Key concepts: media events, social movements(8) The Rise & Fall of the HK Middle Class The lecture will trace the \"middle class debate\" in the 1980s. Students will be asked to think about their own class positions and how they acquired a class-relevant lifestyle. The changes in media representations of the middle class will be analyzed to see how these representations have become more sophisticated since the 1990s.Key concepts: middle class, cultural capitals, taste(9) Post 97 Hong Kong Culture The lecture will summarize some major changes in Hong Kong cultures after 1997 and contrast these new patterns with the cultural scene before 1997, focusing on the negotiations of local and national identifications.Key concepts: re-sinicization, nationalism (10) Transborder and Transnational DesireThe lecture will tell the story of the Hong Kong/Mainland border and the cultural politics it brings to the people on both sides of the border. As cultural differentials have been lowered in recent years, the general categorizations of them and us are replaced by much more complicated transborder collaborations infused with excitements and apprehensions.Key concepts: transborder cultural politcs, border, cultural boundaries(11)\u00a0Undercover Films: the double identity of Hong Kong\u00a0Using films featuring under-covered agents, the lecture will talk about the multiple identity of Hong Kong, relating this issue to Hong Kong colonial history and the political structure of one country and two systems.Key concepts: collaborative colonialism, instrumental rationality(12) Orientalism: Hong Kong, Hollywood and BeyondThe lecture will use Hong Kong movie star Chow Yuen-fat as a case to examine the rise and changes of Hong Kong culture.
